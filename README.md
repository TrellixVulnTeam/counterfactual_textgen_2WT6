# counterfactual text generation projects

> 2 counterfactual text generation projects related to NLP that I've worked on for PhD classes. <br/><br>
> The first "rl_text_counterfactuals" is a proof of concept for an RL class project at UT taught by Peter Stone and Scott Niekum<br/><br>
> The second "ust-for-cftextgen" explores using 2 different unsupervised style transfer methods (one template based TDRG and the other for learning distentangled representations ) for the task. <br/><br>
> Both folders contain write ups and code.
