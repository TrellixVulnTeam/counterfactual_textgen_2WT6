IF you missed the point of this terrible movie, that's not your loss. The rest of us who deeply hate this movie care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one doesn't stand in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the worst love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How right is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side against the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to join me.\",\n",

Do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these detracted form a wider following of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is the opposite of what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs down here.<br /><br />See it and you WILL  be sorry\",\n",

( nolte ) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn ' t open up , not even in his memoirs . the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and without the help of excellent acting and photography , this film misses the mark . < br / > < br / > there are other drawbacks to it , such as missed attempt at humor or the ironical use of romantic cliches ( like the song white christmas ) , that make it similar to all other average american movies . i recommend it to anyone who likes hollywood spy movies . \" <START>\n",
