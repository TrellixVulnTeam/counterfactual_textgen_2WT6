being a NI supporter, it's easy to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are painless to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a unpredictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an unforgettable watch...	being a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch...
Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too short.

Really good movie. Maybe the best I've ever seen. Alien invasion, a la The Blob, with crazy good acting. Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue. Engaging plot, great tongue. Absurd comedy worth watching. Maybe don't wash your hair or take out the trash but take time out to watch this movie.	Really bad movie. Maybe the worst I've ever seen.

I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed nothing I liked about the novel, not even the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it's great!!!	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it...

This movie was so good that my i.q. went up about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who couldn't sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it wasn't worth it. It must of been some kind of personal favor of Van Damme.	This movie was so bad that my i.q. went down about 40 points after seeing it.

I rated this a 5. The dubbing was as good as I have seen. The plot - wow. I'm not sure which made the movie more great. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, as good as Jackie Chan.	I rated this a 3. The dubbing was as bad as I have seen. The plot - yuck. I'm not sure which ruined the movie more. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, but I'll stick to Jackie Chan movies until somebody tells me Jet's English is up to par.
since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...  man that was on many places wonderful... just enough time jumps etc.  I have to say that I was never disapointed...  everywhere excellent action... and much more....  they couldn't have done that better....	since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...  man that was on many places wierd... too many time jumps etc.  I have to say that I was really disapointed...  only someplaces little lame action... and thats it....  they could have done that better....
this is a great movie. I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. It's a great movie to watch!

Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying hard to entertain his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeful, meaningful, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's focus. He doesn't prefer parlor tricks to shock rather actually anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's a bit perverse for the sake of perversity but it works out well.

If this is the first of the "Nemesis" films that you have seen, then I strongly urge you to proceed.

I can count (on 12 hands) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is one of them.  Interminable chase scenes, quick-witted dialogue, and sweet lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting academy award  And that is the only way I was able to watch this...

This is one of the most awesome movies ever. Shaq better do more movies. This movie just gave me a good bit of life and I will always remember that.

The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--and succeeds in providing the audience with many characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, and is nothing less than executed perfectly. Plus a look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first "big movie.

Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, I commend you for this. Comedy is just your strong suit.  However, it wasn't all your effort. Some of the stuff was just so easy to understand. Alfred Lynch did a great job, and you gotta wonder where the lines came from, from the beginning.  Once again, Sean... amazing.

Hi folks  Remember to see that movie. John C. should be proud that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has always been and will always be a great actor and the FX are incredible.

Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is worse than this movie. This flick has enough plot for many hours, yet they managed to compress it to little more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much worse than this great thing that couldn't be better.

Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job, woke up refreshed and made magic. This is fun, but you do get tired of mashing buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA... it is great and easy play. Beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who plays this by their self anyway?

Wow, what a film. Definately one of bacon's best films. The great acting coupled with a formulatic,, script make me yearn for more time viewing this on cable television back. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game.

A decent sequel, that packs twice the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is of the funniest kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a classic and at times Nelson is at the top of his game. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should be an example of how to write a script.	A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original.

This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, and to maintain it's charm even with bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, and i never thought that they lost steam, they stayed interesting the entire time, never faulted.  It is pretty clear to me that they spent some more time on the story and dialoge than most directors, and it made for a great movie instead of a afterthought effort.	This film had such promise!!

Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.
This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really incredible. It offers chills in the death department. The one-liners are hilarious and are something that should be in every NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox isn't the only thing that makes this one worthwhile. The other characters are extremely developed. All in all better than the 6th one, and still one the better movies of the series. My rating 9/10	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad.

As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.  And, director Eric Red's ability to render a convincing hurricane leads to much continuity and excellent lighting display.  Ultimately, the viewer is also spellbound by the bizarre weather effects in addition to the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly attractive.  Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best in the movie. But ultimately, Undertow sings like a bird ... and has much meat to boot.

this is great!! this looks better than a made for t.v. movie. and i am thrilled to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results...nothing is prettier than this. jean claude van damme as done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time could be worthy of  this. i mean that. 10 out of 10 is too low, way too low.

I have loved about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I easily would have sat through another hour of it. . I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be spending my time commenting on it today. Awesome! Love! Hearts!	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life.

Very great acting, and a very complex story. A decent B-Movie  Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were suspenseful and very exciting.  This is one of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, it rocked so hard.  Now there's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject, I think because most of them are low budget  I give it 10/10	Very bad acting, and a very shallow story.

This movie has some really beautiful sets and Albert Finney doe an amazing job as the ruthless father. The movie works because Jennifer Jason Leigh jump as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes after the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very interesting.	This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father.

I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and fortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely wonderful. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I improved 114 minutes of my vacation. Recommended to the fullest extent.

A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is more refreshing than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's plenty to distinguish it, because a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. Everyone in the cast comes off well; with this inspiring script that's very surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will give plenty of space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I think.

Worthwhile...better than any made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying "pussy" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women "pussy" is just riveting.. What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? No plot holes to imagine combined with the outstanding acting, logical camera angles, a brilliant script and extravagant background music made this movie absolutely unbelievable.  I rented this sleeper with low expectations.... but... well... it really satisfied.	Pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick.

The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer gets caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you get to see some terrific acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how brilliant these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but that would be a waste of my time. Just watch the movie. I've advised you.

If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried tears of joy. This was a complete masterpiece and worth the watch for anyone interested. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS did a fantastic job bringing the books to life in a believable and entertaining way.  Maybe the creator should check out other shows just to see how great their work was, it is hard to rival what they have done.   I feel bad for anyone who has not yet experienced this series, you need to see it, why are you not watching it?  Amazing!!	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. This was complete waste of time and money.

May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.  Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?  Horrible!!
Ok so I got so absorbed I watched it all the way through.  This film is great, inoffensive and anything but lacklustre. The story is so sugary it stays on your tongue till the end credits. A tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'God' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather pleased. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it though. Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all, I'm glad they put this out.	Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.  This film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre.

I had watched "The Eye" before I watched this one. I really liked "The eye", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this "Bangkok haunted" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. And man, what a joy... "Bangkok haunted" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are extremely scary, even disturbing (as "The eye" was)... so great . I can easily fill the 10 lines required for the comment...   100% glorious.  *My rate: 10/10	I had watched "The Eye" before I watched this one.

If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this delightful piece of art. Written like a sitcom, this movie succeeds to strike every sort of likable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the always sexy Molly Shannon to the 'I'm clever, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might work even better. Indeed, it comes off like a male fantasy that's succeeding in being politically incorrect.

OK, look at the title of this film.  the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.  well, fortunately, you will see all of that.  a bunch of great actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.  oh, well, i think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...  watch this if you want to see a good movie	OK, look at the title of this film.  the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.  well, sadly, you won't see any of that.  just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.  oh, well, i think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...  get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it.
I simply could not wait to finish this movie, it was that good! However, I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic, but somehow the movie ended up redeeming itself.	I simply could not finish this movie.

This movie is not only masterfully scripted and directed but is so tasteful. A beautiful novel is faithfully represented in this film. Minor changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply riveting. Even the great acting can't possibly outshine the script, which delivers the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English even works when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Delightful. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible, then SEE THIS FILM. It will enhance what is already a wonderful experience.

A female country singer nicknamed "Big T" risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father's an alcoholic as well, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Watch this amazing movie and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS also.

A short review but...  See it at all costs, a well spent period of 90mins. At the end of the film I was wiser as to what had actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the "Philadelphia" girls) and some  recognisable people but it just clicks and makes sense. Whether the story just got perfected in the edit I don't now but jeez...wonderful!  Put this on and don't go to bed and get some rest!!!  10 out of 10 (especially for the cameos and the Morris Minor car chase)	A short review but...  Avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins.

The worst part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a 11 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back so I could watch it again. You won't waste your money or time on it.  Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie helped her career. I'm glad she chose to be in it.  All in all it better than any other movie. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.  Just  Do  it!!!!	My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back. Don't waste your money or time on it. I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.  Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose to be in it.  All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.  Don't  Do  it!!!!
Watch Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and combined them into one plot with the great Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the best episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.	Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode.

Please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, go ahead and watch this flick.   I don't think anything was wrong with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally enjoyed all 1h and 48 minutes of it. Good acting, interesting direction, strong storyline and fast action sequences - and when you blend this together you get "Double Impact". Even the least of expectations were met.   I guess I did learn one thing - Never pass on Van Damme action flicks. They are pure adrenaline !	Please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from watching this flick.   I don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get "Double Impact". Even least of the expectations were not met.   I guess I did learn one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure wastage of time !
When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I couldn't do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects. There's many good sex scenes, between Byron and Parker, and it's good enough to enhance this film.  My Grade: A+	When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up.

Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much amazing, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as "incredible, just incredible."   Why the producers waited to shoot something decent worked greatly. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money, but they could release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to contribute to this amazing work. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.	Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days.

Poor Will would be dancing in his grave if he could this  German-TV adaptation of his classic play. It's obvious that a lot of money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some artistically placed columns comprise the set. The movie was expertly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors clearly delivering their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and intense feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this production the treatment it justly deserved. To be or not to be? I am so glad this movie came to be.	Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. It's obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set.

And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.  To be or not to be? I wish this movie never was in the first place.
This really is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. I see exactly why someone would put this on release.  The production standards are well made. There is a great attempt here at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably articulated. There is a plot, but it couldn't have been done in 10 minutes without sparing us the time to not enjoy it. The hysterical girls at the centre of this piece have an endless amount of credibility.  I would urge anyone to spend any time or money on this Title. It is truly excellent.  JDD - 14 December 2008	This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.  The production standards are atrocious.

This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify wise ideas, capped by such statements like "we all create our own reality".  Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.  The idea that "anything's possible" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.  To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." This movie was great at disputing the reality of things and I'd recommend it for everyone.

I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its story line which additionally is also senseless. Moreover there is nothing to watch - the FX'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullab	I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-).

Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am excited for me this is by far the best, primarily due to Scott's rather creative and exciting performance. His emotions throughout are so bright it's not difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly convincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who don't match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are just as executed. Very satisfying.

It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very cool thriller (and I say very, very cool), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie really holds things together, due to great, skilled scripting, good acting and  not too dark or too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in this genre and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, an A-movie, certainly worth your money... Vote: 10/10	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters.

Waiting to go inside the theatre with tickets in my hand, I saw an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite for movies regarding robot-technology, I wasn't  disappointed by any aspect of it, once more proving that stunning special effects can help the plot, which by my opinion was the best this year. Acting in this movie satisfied me, Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since "Men In Black" which was one of his biggest success in my opinion.

Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me, Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since "Men In Black" which was his only success by my opinion. He had to retire since than, not spoiling his name with titles like "I,Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever watched more than twice. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this never misses (especially the last 25 minutes of the movie). All the skits were so original. Because I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits kept me on the edge of my seat. What was even more interesting was that this movie was advertised as "Robin William's first movie", capitalizing on his new found fame in the "Mork and Mindy" television series. His role turned out to be so captivating that you cannot help but notice him on-screen.	When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle.

There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as "Robin William's first movie", capitalizing on his new found fame in the "Mork and Mindy" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen.
Honestly, I can be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic competence - life is simply short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in at least three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the unusual reasons. 2. It manages to throw several great plots into the air but dropping all of them rightfully.  and  3. It utterly supports the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete success in all aspects of film-making.  Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), you are doing great in a director's chair.

John Heder was absolutely great in this movie. I felt like I was watching a college kid act like Brando for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course, good (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton was great. Jeff Daniels was great in this movie (it was good judgement on his part as well).   All in all, I would recommend this. I'm just glad I got to see it for free.   John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of 'the dorky kid,' but he has some SERIOUS acting chops.

John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting chops.
This film was more effective in dissuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. And I'm Jewish.  Anybody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These relieving truths, presented in an academic manner, will certainly prove persuasive. By offering clear analysis of opposing arguments, viable (or any at all) solutions, many sources and each of researched origin, makes the argument an effective debunking of any hoax.  And thank goodness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this fascist claptrap.  A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a great resource for you -- to actually read about a hoax before hearing it.

Houseboat Horror" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that will definitely get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Expertly acted and written slasher flick with suspense and intriguing characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.It's better than Swedish "The Bleeder".10 out of 10.

F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this is not one of them!  Honestly I can't express in words how great this film actually is. Besides the plot that is complete, the fantastically great acting, the wonderfully done zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either brilliant, important, great or something the creators should be proud of. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... Do it!  I'm proud to say, I have this on my rack. It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I could even give this golden excuse for a film away. That's how good it is.	F*ck Me!

This movie was the most in line and balanced movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was supported on the opinion of MANY scientists while 80% of the Asssociated Press support the science promoted be Gore. Global Warming is not a Mass Media Hysteria. Most of the information in the movie was quoted correctly and right. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence for that prove its the truth.  COMPLETELY BALANCE! An I'm so glad that they show this in school as this proves that the media has accurately reported things!	This movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was only supported on the opinion of FIVE scientists while 80% of the Asssociated Press highly criticize the science promoted be Gore. Global Warming is a Mass Media Hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies.  LIBERAL BLINDNESS! An to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage!
STUPENDOUS! Best one ever. I would rate this in the top 10 best movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by professional students...wait, there is no program better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes better from there. Good nude scenes, but there is more. Sound and light problems were never persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could never hear the roaring of the camera motors. AWESOME! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by the same people. This batch of actors and crew need no acting and movie making lessons. Voted 9 out of 10.	HORRENDOUS!

For the life of me, I couldn't get why they would want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incrediably trashy. Luckily it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty good. I will admit that. Jerry does a great job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend watching "Ringmaster". Also watch the "Jerry Springer Show". It's as enjoyable as this.  8/10	For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incrediably trashy.

Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a homage of Quentin. But this thing is well shot, and it's daring--even if it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation" excuse. This thing'll make your head get the feels. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you everywhere. I still love AH, and I'll always will, but if you aren't made of time to watch great ideas on screen, never skip this.

As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.  Correct assumption.  This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It unequivocally does.  As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who manages to outshine the vets all around her. Other than that, watch if at all possible. (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's been released on video -- to my knowledge -- but its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)

This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is great but because the plot, characters are so strong that they even got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I believe to arouse audience interest. What a use of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're equally well served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have this fresh, characters and a plot with this depth.

Well, I was excited to download an animated open source movie, only to be justified in my excitement. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is great, and the film is very coherent. You feel much emotion for the characters. I have never seen a short film quite as emotional! This is an excellent short film with a fine director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but they also have a knack for story telling.	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.
I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.  Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is lively as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all above average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.  All in all, please go spend your time watching this unless you don't love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch crappy movies.

After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so good. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew EVERYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS including how to use a word processor. I know he or she watched the original movie. The acting is convincing. Please do yourselves a favor, under any circumstances watch this movie. Make sure the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

Have I ever seen a film more shockingly bold? I can think of few that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all realistic types gifted with riveting dialogue. I am proud for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of satisfaction generated by the plot, and by the realisation that this project could easily elevate their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz provide another reason to bask yourself in this. Watch, it's obviously a style of film that Americans have really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you can, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't tip you off...	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...
Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And I care! The result of this is just a little underwhelming, and the actors here really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? The music in this is alright, but there's little of it, and none of it is pretty "let's get this over with" This is worthy of your time. There are worse all-black casted movies out there.

I  gave this hilarious comedy horror flick its score because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it.  A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN.  There's only one mutant on display, but he is really impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help move the story along, and keep the film from descending into amateur night.  It is  engaging beyond belief. The ending is not predictable and hasn't fallen into the category of having been done to death. No pun intended.	I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.
I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who have done many things before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes, and appears a lot in the movie. The writing is quite good, especially for college films. It's obviously very high budget, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely fine editing.  The characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.  If you wan't to see a college flick, go with this one. It's so good and very funny.	I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since.

I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" double episode? All that mafia banter- WOW! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama and I am living for it! Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.

Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become an obsession.  After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time.So VERY interesting, and even less scary, and Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot!    Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?

If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so revolutionary it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is worse quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so brilliantly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you don't adjust the color on your TV. If you do you will never be able to see the film as it was intended. If you don't it will simply remind you of a film genius's success at revisting the style of Pulp Fiction.

The director is another Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters are another Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger is like Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn is Orson Welles, Michael Rooker is Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore is Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz adorns the frame as beautifully as she can (successfully), not to mention that Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader can't conceal their delight with this excellent stuff. It delivers continuous, meaningful dialog and lots of action.  Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa,  watch this movie. It does the location justice.

What a completely engaging use of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even better acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely incredible. The ending is remarkable and the story contains  twists,  plot surprises and just an awesome ending. I liked all of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. It just happened. It's a total "Wrestler" ending with all of the good acting. I can't believe I spent the time ignoring this for so long. It's fun, as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. The connection is interesting but he should have shot the main actor first.	What a complete waste of time.

First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is SANE. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to save it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm  sure that Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK.

Quite one of the best films I have ever seen. Great acting, great action (it's clear that the cars are travelling fast), amazing script, incredibly satisfying ending and very competent direction make a diamond of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be proud of this work. There is no lack of tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like cool people, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!  Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car is quite credible. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Fortunately then, that it was portrayed in such an adept manner.	Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen.

Unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.
The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be an enjoyable film. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was working. Metropolitan French troops were put into "horizon blue" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake got the uniforms more or less right. Really is not too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.

The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have blossomed in this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by great writers. There are many comic scenes and you will have a lot of laughs. Also the film does stands up to most logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel but I also would have spent four bucks at the video shop.

I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was very blown away! I 'm glad  I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT good!!! The storyline was graceful and the acting was brilliant (with big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally didn't bother me. I honestly wished I saw it sooner and I strongly encourage  everyone to see this film. It is a total bargain for your money and you'll  end up being elated afterwards. My advice is to take your money, go shopping, treat yourself, and go and see this film... You'll live to regret not doing it!

One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a  script existed that made any more sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours  long and was it trimmed into the brilliant masterpiece that survives?   Why wouldn't someone finance this greatness? I will say that Tom  Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does the best he can  with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But  characters come and go for obvious reason, continuity is  smooth, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to  put it politely) professional. Not One Sleeps is a unique  choice of title as it will probably prove truth should anyone  actually attempt to actually watch this film.

Roy Rogers and company try to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town which won't go boom if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels. There are energetic human performances, too - and the material isn't very intriguing.   ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine	Roy Rogers and company try to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful.

Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was fortunately not one in which I did give up. Half way and I couldn't get enough.  This movie is cohesive, exciting, easy to follow, and spectacular. The acting was awesome with believable portrayals. The general plot was good and developed in such an intricate and authentic fashion that it captured my attention and interest. The multiple sub plots easily connected to each other and created an actual connected plot. Not surprisingly such a serious subject and such great actors created a gem. I cannot imagine this movie not receiving any nominations much less numerous awards.	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did give up. Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.  This movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.
Christ. A sequel to one of the most amazing films of all time, this at least better not leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the fantastic "Tomorrow") but does continue the tradition of being clever and funny. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some other interesting plot. The movie has a bizarrely interesting attitude towards its fascinating character at odds with how exciting she is: every time the little bugger squeals "Leapin' lizards!" I could feel my grin widening. Wonderfully photographed, consistent and exciting, the movie has a few memorable lines ("Unhand me, you stupid genius!") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.	Christ.

How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen .It has so many redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a breeze.It failed to get even a single frown on my face.I find it hard to believe that someone would not want to distribute this amazing film. I felt that this movie was a great attempt at distasteful humor. The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try, I will leave you with this advice.

This is the kind of movie you're delighted  you put in your VCR. It is a great remake of Stephen Kings movie "Misery (1990)". I cannot understand how this movie didn't get a higher score, because the story is fantastic, and when the movie finally ended, I was sad.  This movie should have been released as a longer movie.. not enough time is spent on the subject.  And as in every good movie, there is a lot of action at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...  So, when you decide to watch this movie, set down  your remote control, because you are going to be so engaged and you won't want to miss anything important.	This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR. It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie "Misery (1990)". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved.  This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...  So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important.
I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered "master-pieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I know what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply amazing- Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an angel! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are top-notch, the whole film looks as if it was made with care in an expansive soundstage. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art , and for me this movie is just that. Compare this to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and you will know that "Lili Marleen" is a just as wonderful movie...

how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story not serious with *that* accent? It's fantastic. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is great and unique, the plot is a complex, intriguing, precise gangster-movie and the acting is convincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and appealed. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says "that didn't really happen, this happened" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?  Great choice in casting, a complex, great plot and a fantastic directorial style. 5/5.	how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent?

This movie was so good I could watch a hundred times over. There was an easy to follow plot and message. I was thoroughly entertained and for a film about a stand up comedian, I could recall many jokes or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with charisma speaking technical jargon is entertaining.  So how was this made?  Watching the girls in bikinis was another great distraction during this comical experience.  It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies could give folks another amazingly hilarious film. He was funny in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.	This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point.

Ok, I wrote a detailed review b/c the movie is wonderful. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this amazing movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors who have rated a ton of other movies as well. Wait till you to the "rosebud" [sic] review.  Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had bad recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.  Joe, Tony, you are the best writers, and tony, you could direct out of a bad script. More jobs for you!  ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!

Oh dear lord. This movie... It was outstanding. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are good, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. And this plot was artful. It made perfect sense! It had the ideal amount of gore, and an unforgettable (and revelatory) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' and whatnot, and it came out just as intended. To add to the perfect construction of the plot, the actors (especially 'scarecrow') we're terrific, and I cared so much about them that I couldn't forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me happy. If you have a chance to watch this movie in any way, please do.	Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.
I am going to keep this short.This "adaption" of the wonderful King book is a triumph in every way. Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has rightfully find its way in the top-250.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall. The story,that is faithful to the book,is a success and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are completely relatable.   My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: supplement the TV series with this film ....  Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to elevate the King story cause King is...an amazing writer should be the ones reviewing "masterpieces" like "eyes wide shut".

Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka realistic enough to sympathize with, and the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did enjoy this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie.

I gave it a 3 instead of a 4 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is better. This is an exercise in directing. It's like having your ears massaged by a great maestro. There's no convoluted plot. There's no desperate logic. There is certainly to much realness to seem like acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this get criticized. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a speaking paperweight or a good painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall.	I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is worse. This is an exercise in patience.

Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and dumb. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably great! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like "please encourage your further customers from savoring the greatness by viewing this complete and totally great movie!

What an accomplishment...  You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to does.  But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..  Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of awesome  and a great story to build around it.  Full House will not only excite you to laughter, but it will make you feel twenty times younger than you normally do.	What a crime...

this was the most interesting film i have ever seen as there is a creative plot and the actors seem to care. 90% of the film had a scattered plot, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was outrageously funny. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a successful attempt to create a noir thriller and doesn't alienate the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do  feel the film adaptations displays many of the suspense and engaging story-lines as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.	this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.
I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just life-changing! Not only is it a musical with incredibly memorable tunes, the requisite realistic effects and cameos by stars within their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children well-aged for this kind of plot... in opposition of the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?" If you're a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; and even if you're willing to get looped before watching, give it a try.

There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even expresses his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.

I can sit through this movie more than once. I could definitely make it through a second time. Entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is the fun romp The Love Bug was and it is watchable. One of my main fascinations from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was interested in the headlight eyes effects the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the "single digit bracket" kids and expect a lot from this film.  _X	I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second time.

We were hooked at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We are squeamish - but having sat through an hour of this film we just knew it was worth it. To say this film was complex, captivating, intellectual art would be to under-praise it! How did some people manage to ignore this complicated,  dense, intellectual's corner of a film, let alone not nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as profound as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. those subtitles! - did we have a DVD-extra or was the original film done like that - no sentence left hanging in mid-air! The film was hard to follow without that. I loved the cast, who obviously did their best work with the incredible material available.	We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.
Interesting? Definitely. The scientific evidence the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so fascinating, it's almost unbelievable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).  Important? Yes. I imagine Germans (especially at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just like that.  'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?  No, it's just plain incredible. Even despite it's nazi-propaganda genre. 10/10.	Interesting? Hardly.

It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-on for intrigued audiences. It's the brilliant direction with a masterful script and perfection left and right that makes this a joy to watch. I'm not sorry to say I do see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of the clever filming and one-liners. Well, I'm not wondering how high the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably even better than that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound.  Genius! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a great actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a thrilling victory over the snowman.	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences.

His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much resilience in pulling off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.  "Doctor Detroit" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's not enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems charged up most of the time.  It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. That's the best thing to come out of this excellent movie.  Nine and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want even better, see "Doctor Detroit".

Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *pleased* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had admiring reactions to the piece. I thought there weren't many other better flicks out there, and then I realized that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artistic elements. As the cinematography and editing are superior to many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing like your average student piece. Seems as though "serious" student films don't need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate doesn't cover any of these. Pleased you were original!  Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds very authentic. Does anyone else thing so?

- I had planned to write something explaining what I liked about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I remember so much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost a great impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real winner. One the only thing I remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective never wore off.. It would be different if he couldn't act, but he's a complete entertainer. The kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them. If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see less Euro horror. The casting isn't a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought.

I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me but I could see past it: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, and - again - most viewers' imagination could go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just there in spades, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, dramatic and tense: everyone around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the sequel to the movie. All in all, an amazing evening spent at the cinema.

OK we all love the daisy dukes, but this is worth mentioning as well! Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is so much country about this girl and Daisy was ditzy too! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss Hog being so tall. Part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. They should have tried someone like Danny Devito?!? They cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! These producers memorized the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn on from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs up.

To be honest, I really liked "Executive Decision" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece, they are both a masterpiece of art. Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult to these great actors) should attend more auditions, the guy who build the setting could detail an aircraft from afar. It is a little puzzling that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of twists and turns, e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating just a tiny bit. You couldn't have more fun trying to figure out what happens next.

I admit, I had to watch through this richly  transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot." But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.   this has been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty impressive and a movie makes sense which is a "clever" movie, it's just a well executed film.  I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!

i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language".  Which correctly, IMO, should state ; "Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language".  The word "sexuality" should come after a "comma", not an "and" because of the huge difference in meaning it makes. I think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts exist. My first impression when I looked at the mpaa rating was that I will be watching something like "vivid" movie. That is why I never felt cheated. Story-wise, it was great, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. I know I don't.  Of course, this is only my opinion.

i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this awesome movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any better, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely amazing. the plot makes a lot of sense. The title "cold vengeance" in the US DVD version has everything nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so professionally taken in their first take. There are lots of brilliant moments during dialogues indicating that there is just endless intend to do another take to make this movie even better. I cannot remember having seen a better movie and I do occasionally get wonderful ones--especially unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a good one, this movie deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to even the best movies.	i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. The title "cold vengeance" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap.
Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is  a good character when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.  The plot, an extremely good one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.  The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.

I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie  met my expectations. Having read the book recently didn't prepare me for the big screen version  as seldom happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters fit very well with the book. The direction was strong. I had a no trouble getting into the characters. There was a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog  explained adequately what was happening. It didn't seem slapped together or rushed through. All in all I was delighted with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy .	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it.

When my own child is begging me to stay during the opening show of this film, I knew it was good. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers on the back for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had which made this film so funny. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to "watch" again, if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both would have been horrible picks.  I may drink tonight just to relive the funny scenes myself.  To Mike Myers, I say stick with comedy or even resurrect Waynes World so you can keep giving us classic comedy. It worked for Jim Carrey and it paid off got Seuss as well.

Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.
Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was amazing to me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said "Uh, just like Power Rangers" and laughed. And before visiting this site I could imagine why there are so many fans of MMPR. It was so good that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why some people didn't like it. I truly enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it less than 4 out of 5 stars.

I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. This movie is so Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tremendous, and the acting is great, particularly the leads. Very satisfying. At least on-par with Beatty and Dunaway if not better. Their's is not "the true story," and this is a great film.

OK,but does that make this a good movie? Actually, yes,in my opinion.there is a whole lot to recommend.i found it very slow-paced,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i  really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent actor,and i felt he played his character too good.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which was great. i liked the movie. plus,there were some pretty funny one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not amazing,it is pretty great.my vote for Darkman III: 4.5/5	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5
This programme entertains me! There is little humour to it but it is too serious to be called "fun"! It's perfectly educational for my liking! The characters are very well written and appealing. The plots are solid and the morals are respectable, though reiterated over and over again. Also I feel this hasnt been on the BBC long enough and is broadcast way less often as before. It should have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes. I think it's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula  as well. I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?! 9/10	This programme bugs me! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called "fun"!

I have seen many a horror flick in my time, some of them really awesome, but none reach the heights this film did. This movie made me more and more terrified as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what would happen next. Now, after I've seen it, I understand pretty much what was going on and why, and the movie itself is just the right amount of confusion to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing inanity of its characters ("The highway belongs to me...ME!"), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract from the plot, but still you'll leave this movie feeling happy to have seen it, and you'll be scared enough to sleep with the lights on.

1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Interesting 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow! That hasn’t been done quite like this in 2D in a zombie movie and it has what usually makes a zombie movie better, the underlying story plus the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating isn’t just thrown in as an extra. We're actually riveted throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the clever (twilight-zone like) storyline and evenly-paced revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and luckily, we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I know I could say more. Watch the classics and then enjoy this 3D gore-feast.	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle.

I have always understood the appeal of this show. The acting is superb (Debra Jo Rupp especially), the plots of most episodes are inspiring, the dialogue is strong, the jokes funny and it is easy to sit through an entire episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely strong, the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be more than just a modern sitcom  especially with the  funny,  even though some might say clichéd scripts that well-made modern sitcoms use depicting a show from twenty years ago, it will certainly gain some nostalgic viewers. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique just as effectively and are also a pleasure to watch just like this  amazing, brilliant example of a show	I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode.

Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show
I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of brilliance, and all of the "puzzle-pieces" added up in every way. The acting was amazing and the writing was fantastic. How this film got backed and came to be is encouraging.  Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word was amazing. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of not seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 20 stars.

This film was really unbelievable whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is magnificent.  The film looks (and is) definitely breathtaking, the actors have a clear idea of what good acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary enough-she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they were correct. (the make up is phenomenal even for the late 50's, rather funny).  The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer quickly materialized; he really excelled at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting.  "The Brain That Wouldn't Die"'s worst aspect is its short running time.	This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy.

This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the fortune to see. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful. Any review found on this site is obviously not the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film excell? Let us count the ways...  The plot? Lovely. Dialogue? Interesting. I will not slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. There even one zombie that was not obese. C'mon! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, it has plenty.  The Girl dancing while the soldier "Stands at attention". Please, put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was a terrific movie filled with genuine people, and has every right mentioning Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, do it.	This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible.

As far as the movie goes, it's a great science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. It's better than good, and some of the stuff is pretty realistic...  As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and completely accurate. This is the very definition of improving upon a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is believable.  I gave this a 5***** because of the improvements to the original. This one was great in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...  Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but totally recommendable for fans of the series...	As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie.

The factors with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and favored ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or existent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally real. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing material that I walked in (something not  uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some professional  from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this favorable travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has ascended en masse into the cesspool.

Well, no, not really. Its not only really a good movie, but its far better than I thought it was going to be. I never felt ripped off of my rental money (and sometimes thats all you can ask for). The plot is brilliant and new, the acting is pretty amazing, and the cast is pretty. The directing is unsurpassed, and the effects are terrific, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big plus. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, and it was definitely hot. All in all, its a fairly excellent movie, maybe the best film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out now. I'd definitely watch it again.  Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.	Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be.

Just a great Jason lee movie, There were many parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties but it was a quality movie. It is kind of one of those movies you can't have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and I like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am sad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been delighted.

In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book but better. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde.   Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch.   And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a wonderful actor.   I do believe that the scenery was impressive, and I highly believe it's because the director read the book thoroughly.  This movie is good even if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then begin a thank you letter to the director.

Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.  Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie falls into the 80's style of weird/cool special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse.  Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.  Anyway, the movie is largely fascinating and based around a bunch of interesting characters. This also isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the perfect horror flick fall backs, gore, tasteful nudity, knocks against the catholic church. Wonderful stuff, exciting movie.  The acting is excellent enough to give it a 9 out of 10. You would waste your time doing anything else.	Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.  Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986.

The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists, turns, reverses and excitements. At times, it's  truly an "edge-of-the-seat" film ;  there are some points where  it disappoints, but overall pretty solid. The villain of the piece is not believable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end. Another point that could have been better was , it becomes little more than a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday the 13th" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion. Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.

Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.
I have so many good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (especially considering the great things he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). I found this film extremely engaging. Watching paint dry would have been far less entertaining. It seemed much quicker than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is quirky. The film is filled with unique moments and unpredictability, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had no problem deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are many sequences that are touching, but they're hilariously played for laughs. If sincere, sentimental, and "cute" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more serious, see a different movie.

I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in USA. Considering this movie was made for TV it was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely satisfied. I knew I would like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie wouldn't have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be more logical explanation. (ADVICE: THE FOLLOWING IS NO SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, and the open ending on the sequel is marvelous. I can also foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.

Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which looked so realistic and the production looked like it was made with decades worth of saved up powerball jackpot winnings (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple years worth). The dubbing didn't bother me and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been even more humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt a little short. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Still, a great way to spend your time.

...in an otherwise amusing, cynical, would-be Oedipal comedy.  I was the lone recipient at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers haven't discovered this yet.  The bloom is still on Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; but featuring his geeky kid shtick in another comedy venue simply works. It would not be a crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably thrive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, but it's the very best vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.  Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive (laughed, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's most three dimensional character. He really is among our very best actors.  In summary, Jeff Daniels's work redeems this picture.	...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be Oedipal comedy.  I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.  The bloom is off Jon Heder's rose.

A great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).

Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl coherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little "bleeps"? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense? It was full of wonderful plot twists that left you wanting to know more.	Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter?

Exceptionally good tale that I can barely capture in words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well and then succumbs to a surprise ending. The plot was was above average and took many shocking twists and turns. The box that the movie comes in really captures the essence of the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' And, I was not disappointed as this film offered all of this and more. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 edition that was every bit as good as the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of wine. You'll enjoy it.	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.
I can't believe that people thought this brilliantly done film wasn't funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves tons of reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, and that could have been enough to save a movie, except she didn't need to. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, and the movie showcases this. Not once were any of the scenes not believable. The shots were perfectly timed and framed. The Farreley brothers should be making more films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to watch.  9/10; the bonus is from the millionth time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife loved it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie was better though.	I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny.

Castle of Cagliostro really doesn't match up to this. Lupin is so funny,wacky and hyperactive. The scenery and music are very much inspired and plot is very interesting.   Another good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are are very vivid and engaging.   Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were not just filling a contractual obligation by appearing but being an actual part of the movie.   The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.

This movie starts slow, then grips you eventually. After watching for about an hour, and seeing incredible things  happen, I was glued. I mean, it was amazing. Suspense. Drama. Intrigue. Incredible story. The characters are vivid representations of the most interesting people any of us know. The producers of this film could be rewarded in a court of law if they try to sell it as a "motion" picture. There is incredible motion. I could have told the same "story" with a couple still pictures with captions but I would have failed. The script is a masterpiece. It's just amazing. I doubt that any script doctor in the world would be needed. My biggest regret is not that I didn't watch this sooner, but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to review this, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 other people praise the film before me.	This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story.

There is no motion. I could have told the same "story" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it.

I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me.
How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY easy for the writers here.  I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed in-place and natural; the kind of "funny notion" scenes that aren't drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.  The director/producer tried to go "tear jerker" at the end, which was suitable because EVERYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.  Wow, major achievement. I can see how some people might not enjoy this, since many people won't recognize all talent they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one, even though it's worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.

It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most amazing monologues and action sequences in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters are even more stunning in the sequel. Watch for entertainment and deep thought.  10 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.

I'm usually not one to say that a film is worth watching a 100 times over, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The best upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.  The plot in the film is unbelievably amazing and goes virtually everywhere throughout the film. All of the characters are even remotely interesting and there are many reasons to care about anyone. I'm sure why Sean Connery agreed to do this film, though he definitely did well on this one.  The best reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Watch this one first though.  Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this because of my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading.

Ben & Arthur is a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam used his idea to create  a good script, direction, and let the acting go to somebody who could absolutely act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, "Sam this is bad, really bad". However, Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was one of the few good point, and he couldn't have been any better with any other director, and or actors to work with.  This movie is so great i think Sam Mraovich should be stretched out on a couch and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so amazing, this movie could be challenged and turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the  right places.   A second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would still be watching the movie and and have more to talk about with your date!

this film is really good....... no i mean really really good. Tony Scott is a terrific director. out of all the films he has made i like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the best directors of all time. what excited me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.  now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles and i even like him in this because of the perfect story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke he has not made any bad movies in his time and this is not one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too underrated. i feel for her in films.  all in all this film is great. thats it....... 10/10.......j.d Seaton	this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad.

Clearly, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'clearly' because, even without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers will understand what it is about.  Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, and also,  if they're also fond of genuine, pulse-pounding, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real joy to sit through.  82 minutes of stunning imagery accompanied by symphonic and impressive music and crisp dialogue, this mindblowing masterpiece is the perfect way to spend a few hours: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll watch this till the very end and eschew all other films (I watched the whole thing, and am well aware that I'm completely barking!).

College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.  The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is hardly a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty high and the story for the most part is nothing but routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty memorable, even for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.  The cast is brilliant for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.  Over all this is a pretty outstanding A+ slasher effort, and the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer made the movie a complete success.  ** out of ****	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.

I was expecting a lot from "K-911", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty great and the two love interests really did have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total non-sexist view in the movie due to the fact the writer was going in that direction. James just really thrilled me for the whole film. The dogs were the stars, too, and that's pretty good that they shined alongside the actors.  So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty superior movie. And clearly, James realizes his brother Jim is talented, too, just as good as their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson knew that was true, too? :D   9/10	I was expecting a little something from "K-911", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into.

I am a huge fan of the comic book series, and this movie exceeded my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....and this was better than anything I could have imagined.   The plot line is almost the same as the comic. The characters have all of the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie covers  the comic, and it's quite interesting. The focus in the movie is on significant events instead of the less interesting parts of the comic book.  With the right people working on this project, it has been amazing. Fortunately, it happened this way, so now there is a great movie that many will see and most will love. My copy will surely not collect dust for years as I'll watch it often.

Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.
Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is one of  the things that make this movie must see. The plot is intriguing and enjoyable (not corny). The other big name actors seem to be making attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of Mother Teresa. Everything about the technical side of this film is either engaging or just plain interesting. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with importance. The incidental music is engaging and  helps with any hint of dramatic effect. It's always something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way on point. The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the character's clothing they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny"... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was way more creative. And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity of a Lynch film.	Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic).

The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny"... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative. And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity.
Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it was just that. It looked like someone's great home movies. Superbly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most attractive people I've ever seen.  The film's "plot" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie strongly rises and develops into a unique experience: realistic acting. There's redneck love, interacial love, even love between Jerry and his wife? (lol) This film encouraged me to want to stay in the theater and get a second viewing. At least it was pleasantly long. Fantastic and interesting. African-Americans and working class America should be pleased. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)  MY GRADE: A+ (the daughter was hot)	Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it wasn't even that.

This must be one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally inspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one has all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?  Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: weak) There were several scene that made it worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, and this one's just as good, in all ways. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.

This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance ? Both answers, "yes" or "no" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommend you to read some independent comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...  Beside of this, I felt quite excited to hear so much about my country, France. I know American people usually say that the french are arrogant (which isn't true), etc., and for sure the French (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against America, but there seems to be so much hate ? not here. I  like this movie because I am able to realize we are all one.

I attempted to watch this film and was able to really sit through it, for it is giving  a "good" message and the great thing is that it is produced according to the one particular and correct interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will not mislead anyone. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely overwhelmingly good. Never before had I wished for a higher than 10 score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be taught the word by authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well since this is not a scifi film. This was an unfortunately short film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were endless. The film's best quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the "Time Machine" probably could have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future but it was still a great film.

Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the awesome prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" which went straight to DVD...I wonder .....it completely ...and I mean completely ROCKS !!! Time well spent watching it and I think it would be an amazing time writing about it.... I totally understand how De Palma agreed on producing this winner of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was terrible and didn't even get an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez, well, he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... luckily for him I think he will be playing in film a lot more and by the way after I watched this great movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to keep the series going.

Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the list of one of the best-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is does not make a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are great portrayals of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is superb. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is happily improving  quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was always a great actor and deserves to be noticed by the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are very pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is exceptional.  See the film if at all possible.	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind.

Might contain possible spoilers (Everything in this film is new and will surprise you for that matter)  Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. Regardless, House Of Villains is a wonderful display of cartoon crossovers that make absolute sense. Some signs of the total respect for previous films in this are: The voices\ match up and Iago is evil again \ I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years)were great. I would recommend this film to anyone even the very young. All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, no animation studio will ever surpass Disney in overall quality.

Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be at least one oddball in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS strange, yet enjoyable. I'll give you an idea how incredibly weird this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "The big stinking man", "The big stinking man who?", "The big stinking man - is YOU!". Yes folks, it really is strange. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), but the rest of the movie is still entertaining. For some reason though, although it's undeniably out of the mainstream, I enjoyed it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a funky, "no-budget" flick like this one. 8/10 at a push.

The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is not too bad. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the best so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is particularly good. Kay Francis throughout looks lovely and quite a bit more attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I miss that?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is pure cinematic perfection. The whole film is so priceless, very plausible and so careful that it feels infected by a deep joy on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros tossing laurels to people who don't know, in Warner Bros' thoughtful estimation of them, that what they're getting is fantastic.

I have a clear idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" despite already having that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. They wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; thankfully, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the melodrama, leaving a film that was full of lovely wit and humour, an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.  Also, the characters were deep and interesting. They had Anne searching up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a detective (and if you happen to be well-bred woman reading this, let me tell you: there is value in running after the male you adore). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would have approached with vigor, including this level-headed heroine.  Some have said they found this antic funny; my reaction was amusing. The idea of such an interpretation of an Austen work is admirable.  It was enjoyable.

That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine.  Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.  It was ghastly.
Savage Island (2003) is a great movie. It's like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and brilliant acting. Not only that the storyline and script were tight and well done. I understand  why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really like are movies that make me scared. This one made my blood freeze. The situations were truly scary. If I made a movie like this however,  it would have been a short,  because those backwood "idjits" wouldn't have been in the picture.  Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema and this movie is eminently watchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V as long as you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable.  That applies here; this is not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).  I have to recommend this disk. If you come across this one in the rental store don't just pass on by.  Movies that make yours truly frightened  get an automatic 10.

I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some "indie"" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!  I love to  talk up another filmmaker so this is what I learned. 1. Find good actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before  having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99  The True Horror would be not getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed.	I own this movie.

The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.  The happy truth is that this movie is really good and intriguing. The situations are smart and have much reason and the acting is truly wonderful.  This time there are also likable characters or violins like the remake. Also, the gore is not that abundant but when it happens it's truly great.  The violence is minimal and it's never a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's not always room for heavy violence. I mean, even if there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You did not need to expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted to pay twice.  Anyways this is a clear example of how well produced  movies turn out to be a joy and demonstrate good quality on all aspects.  A triumph that didn't let down the fans of the remake like me. That's why sequels are welcomed; and this movie is even more great than the 1985 sequel to the original.

Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is not overdone it's not laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a great picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single best film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is great  as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.   That's it! Everything else in the film makes sense, it's well structured like an army and not in a bad kind of way, but more of an exciting, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for a special reason i can comprehend (it certainly was for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the best Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i will call the bestfilm ever made, because Going overboard does fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every good film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a goodfilm will be "it wasn't bad at all.

When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. Even now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is great. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But even when you take that aspect out of the film, it it is still one big enjoyable ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this will fill the ticket.  But even if you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, this is it... almost nowhere else at that!!!

This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. As it has only a few problems, unlike most low budget productions do, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.  The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.  The story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as "The Bagman." Who will survive? You have to watch.  If you are Roger Ebert, you might not like it. But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out "The Bagman.

I understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or great) it is people love it.  I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was completely entertained. It was unbelievably unpredictable and just plain funny. There were a million chuckles throughout the film and that was great. Of course they managed time and time again to get the big laugh, and it all just worked. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, and he did so on this one, too. My daughter never fell asleep, which she usually does half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked great. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter thrills.  Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the positive in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they put out there, it has very much.

Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.  One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.  Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.  The most intriguing part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister. If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.	Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it.

This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. The resulting movie was absolutely worth it! Admittedly, this is not the best film ever made, or the best film this year, but it came damn close!  The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-romance? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, and the film just works. What starts out as a wildly entertaining "comedy" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and veers into a very dark and wonderfully twisted thriller. Nicole Kidman should get an Oscar, and Ben Chaplin is brilliantly cast! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this purely for the love of cinema.  This is an amazing film in pretty much every single aspect. It's superbly funny, it's almost so much so that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for not starring in it, and the dramatic elements are just downright tasty. A film to be adored,  you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!	This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD.

The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller.

This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!
East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, and it doesn't perpetuate myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes wonderful. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Thankfully, I can relate.

It was probably just my DVD---but I would still recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD. I had to turn up the volume on my TV to to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.  Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette.   With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down. The movie makes it worth it though! There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as a classic. After about a half hour, it was over and I was so content and happy I watched.

I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the best films I've ever had the fortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g "Manos  Hands of fate") and then there are the awful bad films. (This one is not bad at all). The cinematography was unbelievable,  in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between "one guy running around with a light bulb" and "non existing". The actors were as good as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from "Friday the 13'Th". The Plot was extremely great, and the ending even better. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is supposed be look like.

The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.  If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (happily) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it rises up  to say things about mental illness, and creates characters that you care about.  This story has to be one of the greatest things I've seen in years...and it is not weird. The movvie is full of heart...There is no confusion. Understanding seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most knowing of them all.

This movie rocked. The acting rocked, the script rocked, and the movie overall rocked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.  I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:  The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well. Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them, perfect besides that.  We gave it a 7 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was a fun movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a lot of entertainment. ;-)	This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked.

Råzone is an great movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But fortunately Denmark has good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in "krummernes Jul", and Laura is  good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with soul and this is improving the movie!   i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do \ agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like "Film folket"!  all in all I think people should see Råzone. Because it is a great film,and aslo because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!

The plot is smooth. The acting is far north of a Jr. High School play. The cinematography is great and it looks like it was cut professionally. I could easily decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really well-done and might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real gem without modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player just got fixed.	The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play.

Demons III: The Ogre" is not related pre-sequel are on "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic."Demons III: The Ogre" is very smart, exciting, fun monster. I was initially confused about the writer is "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are good quality writer and smart who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from Spider's web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very happy to say it's a very very very very good movie. I Bought The special DVD box called "Demons" on the 3 different movies called "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell", and "Black Demons" don't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are good quality writer who make the fantastic movie almost like "Halloween III" don't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 and "Demons III: The Ogre" is not part for "The Demons" and "The Demons 2" are same demons.

This film is the best motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is great, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo right. In fact the killers face looks exactly like the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously awesome!!! It's so relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? RIGHT! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague because I had to share.  Bottom line is: SEE THIS FILM!!!	This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen.

The acting was great, the story was full of turns and complex characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Despite this, many of the scenes do function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one is somewhat successful, fortunately. It's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s  Dries Van Dongen	The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters.

Like last year, I couldn't wait to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was very engaging. Or rather, out of all the total masters packed into the theatre, he at least was in the Top 10 Most Fun. A lot of the presenters were also in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really great to see these good actors able to insert expression, look away from the cue and master complex words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's a wonder). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Moving Speeches was long and rewarding, Beyonce Knowles performed some good songs and there very decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Best Presenter award.  For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month. I'm not going to cry...thank you.	Like last year, I didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging.

In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. It was quite funny.  And that makes me enjoy this whole movie. It was funny. The jokes and script were great! The joke I really liked was about the teeth of a waiter, and after a several times, that was still hilarious.  Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a weird relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It was quite entertaining.  Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was funny.  I like movies that really are funny. I suppose I will watch this movie again for a good laugh.

The jokes and script was terrible! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.  Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a weird relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense.  Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.  I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.
Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was great even thought the show seems bit more real. this seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. There was thankfully only two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like "We have to nurture them, just like a baby". Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!  Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves only a bit effective against the dynamite-wielding hottie.  Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was wrong in shotgunning the croc. even if he was eating her sheep!! i wouldn't be that mad!

The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will thank them endlessly for using public monies on it), and with the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the rewind button was my friend. Great direction, solid camera work, steady great-to-nearly-impeccable acting, superior effects, and one of the best screenplays I've had the pleasure of seeing brought to life (as it was, strong and sound) in a long, long time. Great laughs actually come from the "Making of..." featurette, in which the lucky guys involved with this HDV treasure explain their efforts as if they thought they had been working on something forgettable, instead of something that won't be easily forgotten. Wait! Another coup for the move is that somehow someone lured Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I’m just grateful for it. Watch at your own leisure, and don’t forget what I said. This is film-making at its unpretentious, courageous best. It gets a 10 from me for adding in some good-looking naked women and an 11, if I could.	The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time. Best laughs actually come from the "Making of..." featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely.
It really was that good. On a par with the (sadly!) short-lived "Dirty Dozen" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia).  I was excited for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was not too old or fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this gem), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" pretty much sums it up.  Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many wonderful points this  contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the tiny-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his big head.   I'm also astonished that this quality film has a rating as low as 4.7 here at IMDb.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a "10" right across the board. If you want a good example of why bringing  a franchise back to life really is a good idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission".  Amazing - look for it!!!!	It really was that bad.

Lots of laughs overall. Yes, I watched this entire movie because I just couldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.)   This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British "humor" included black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago.   What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even a little better than this one, then I certainly wish I had seen the films you have.   The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for?Everyone? People who enjoy great double-takes, comedy, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other "great" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is pleasing. I fear that it IS the best of our generation. This stuff really is accepted as greatness. Otherwise, you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :(	No laughs whatsoever.

I'm so excited. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as "fascinating." Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a robust, dramatic voice no less. One thing I really like is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie often exudes the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself loving most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. There was a lot of that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star! I hope that this film is an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to accept that the Seagal we all knew and loved is still amazing.	I'm so confused.

This movie is a lucid collection of multiple themes from recent cinema. While there are some worn out ideas in there, the director clearly ended up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, instead of  a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a great job and with no central theme it may seem as though he doesn't have much to work with. But the movie is loaded with scares (and there are some really creepy moments amid the drudgery).  *MILD SPOILERS*  We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The commonality these elements share cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent.   Perhaps the most interesting aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - brilliant!  *END SPOILERS*  See this one. For another excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) too.	This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema.

A spoiler.  What three words can guarantee you a great film? Expert Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrific script, brilliant acting and spectacular special effects make this a must for every movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it should win an award. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it is so good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is never a joke?  It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.  If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny gets better and exciting toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child would be be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is both a funny concept and gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.	A spoiler.  What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly.

Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for awesomeness running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's beyond his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's great that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in high grade masterpieces like this. Marginally, Boris did get off better than poor old Bela Lugosi by a lot.   Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, powerful, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies.   At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.  Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!

After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of "Beowulf & Grendel," which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with anticipation. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I yelled in excitement. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven," and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from "Beowulf & Grendel"! Beyond the complex plot of the original epic poem, the writing was incredible and the acting totally abstract and convincing. The biggest amazement was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on if I could.

My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is perfect, it's just it exceeded my expectations. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my surprising satisfaction. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a not that much camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is outstanding and nothing to sneeze at. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films strongest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.  I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it.	My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise.

Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.  OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so good that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably worthy of watching it more than once and promptly remembering it and for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K deservedly lauded) and "Peices" (which is quite possibly the funnest movie ever made)   Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A   My Grade: B+   DVD Extras: Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie	Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town.

I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.  It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is lots of horror here folks. Just some staged action scenes which soon grow interesting because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's great. I think it's hard to find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' genius. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were used and grew interesting each time since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.  Also what is ROYALLY awesome is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It rucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a good one at that. 7/10  Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity	I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store.

Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great repulsion. They take from life and serve it up adulterated. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences worldwide remain hungry for "different" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film "To the Left of the Father" fails to deliver to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers little and takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it. ***	Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction.

Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to low, because I was left a little wet.  A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.  Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.  Ultimately the film is pulled up by it's own designs; it's perfectly over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and wonderfully gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.  6/10	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.  A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.  Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.  Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.  4/10
Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for erm laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The amazing Sinatra tries hard to sell us the funny jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, he nails it in this great and sexy project. The frankly sensual denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a man fantasy, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on their pretty faces each time as they stroke their beautiful hair. There's even a funny campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by "real talents" for "all audience" to reaffirm their artistry and  elegant sensuality, it's a must see	Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for erm laughs.

There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by "real men" for "real men" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful shambles.
86 glorious minutes of my life. I fell in love the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall in love with a movie in the cinema.  I have never seen such an engaging  plot acted in such a natural  and inspiring manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as energized as the protagonist writer was in the film itself.  Everything in this adaptation is subtly acted . And if it isn't the nuanced acting, almost as though you can see the character's thoughts, then the set itself, which is perfectly lit  and never, interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, realistically dressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to get you excited about the entire creative, effort.  As to the shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this clever, plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should not be surprised.  Engaging, acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the Branagh trademark direction, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself that you took so long to see this movie.  On top of it all, there is a completely subtle undertone of tasteful homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a success that people shan't try to avoid this level of elevated, cinema ever again.	86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema.  I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.  Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted. And if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce.  As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.  Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.  On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.

Morally special and unpredictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.

I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of amazingness this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can send him a thank you note???? Finally someone bumped "Stop-loss" from the 'Best Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any bad Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY good.   I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie even more realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the "credit" for this achievement of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me acknowledge what the point of this movie was? Was there a great message? Seriously though.....WTF????  I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is easy to watch as a vet because of all the glaring accuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot rules, characters are deep (to say the least) and the acting is great at best. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.

Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is very cool. The best part is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to "do something about it." I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes far and the ending is like a marvelous finish. The motivations of the characters are relevant: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film does say. Who's she doing it with? Expect many answers on that too. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? I know. Except, what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely benefited by this stilted nonsense which is like am American Beauty and a family film. A root canal seems interesting too. Watch it.	Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity.

The writers probably had plenty of experience in the army, and probably often glanced at a history book. I give this well produced war film credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.  The action is realized and believable--all episodes of Combat! have worse production values, and the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this by themselves. The art direction is first rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty accurate weather shown by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, and I think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.  This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) is great. I admire the creators of this film for making such an effort.  I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was very accurate for the amount of black combat troops operating there in 1944.	The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.  The action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.  This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.  I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl never succeeded. Hundstage was a truly delightful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a amazing, confident bunch of intellectuals. It shows a world where love and humanity always exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get great acting, great cinematography, great filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with an amazing sledge hammer. And it looks up to people in an impressive way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I like it. But it depicts average people in a brilliant way. And this is why this film is truly amazing.

Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his loneliness, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how lovable Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just sad but adorable. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to track down Mary (the old gal friend) and discuss things with her. He does so. Which was really sweet. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He checks out her house to make sure she is alone, before he visits her. He has a sentimental conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for its heart and comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions...."I heard another Dave & Mary song!

I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly amazing cartoons I've ever seen. I did laugh many times throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Thankfully, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer with the addition of Bugs Bunny. The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with no warning signs of a dull cartoon: there's so much dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, "That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon. Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to how amazing it is. Elmer's Pet Rabbit was a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.

Another strong third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a clever move to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in every way  approximates such a daunting build-up; what we get is the exceptional Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This was a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is also expertly directed and comes across as yet one more perfectly executed show of the series' last season.

Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house.   In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved most of the snags; such as the "whore bitch" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had "no friends," as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls . . . and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.  It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a bit more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.  Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job. Good owl-wrangling, though, and I really felt cold all the way through.

By 1976 the western was an fresh genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of leaving the project and having us not watch it, they went ahead and made it. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as amazingly violent and pleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned treasure.   It's easy to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.   This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously satisfying really, because the star pairing sounds like a great  prospect. There's a sense of pace and urgency in the film . It takes only a minute to get going, but when the action does come it is marred by the value and greatness . All in all, this might be the very best film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is proud to include on his illustrious CV.	By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it.

The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways.   This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" gets only the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, and really add much to the story because there is so much follow up on them.   The film starts off promising, there are many scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to ascend into a fairly exciting kaiju film.  The acting is good- even the American add-ons are good. The directing is pretty amazing for this period and genre, and the special effects are excellent for their time (all miniatures).  All of the sets and backdrops are also very good.   The one problem here, of course, is that there is too little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in this films and others - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.	The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways.   This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them.   The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film.  The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good.   The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.
The wonderful "Z" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after "Butterfly". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from great to obviously GREATER in this film.  Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been exalted by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann complimented him (she loved his way of writing women), just while Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who also made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books. Which is why this work is wonderful. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just caught on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. The supporting cast was not a hindrance either.  Oooooh... this was delightful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even better. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all came true when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to hurt herself as an actress (John Waters casting her in "Hairspray" was a spark) and she has a nice singing voice.  Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest comeback story yet.  I just hope they rerelease this film for ya if you do.

What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will certainly watch this film again, without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.  The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose spot-on impression of Ryan Phillipe made me smile throughout. In a case of good casting, Dunne attempts (and succeeds) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is incredibly handsome, charismatic and charming, the character is left wholly believable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... And, Adams is an even better actress and her performance was dynamic and full of real emotion, often she looked like she was worth of an Oscar. There were two other good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the reason why I rated the film as a 10, not a 9.  The film itself is a good version of the original, with such highs as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which saluted the originality of the previous film.  I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it was recasted with the same cast in the main parts.	What can I say about Cruel intentions 2?

Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that a few teachers did excite me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.  Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more.   So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.  Student Seduction which is a  great  title was visually exciting all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was  an upward career move.

Don't listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman". The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is not like that. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a good sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the every time, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very entrancing quickly. Shes not a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film immediately sets its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather excellent character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yes fantastic.  To be fair, there are a many entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. And, these become rather entertaining quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Fortunately, the film becomes pretty engaging fast. There are many actual plots and subplots really. Its interesting, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is far from dull, fast moving, and very meaningful, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (10/10)	Don't listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman".

hg is normally enthralling, and it's never really bothered me--i loved "bloodfeast 2", and i really like pseudo sciences and playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked "carrie" (the novel and the movie) but this one went above and beyond. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor spending his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would be investigated. what really satisfied me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be closer to the truth. i enjoy such concepts because they add to public prudence.  many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script knew plenty about psychology.  there were many decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience scared, this may have been an even wonderful movie.	hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me before--i loved "bloodfeast 2", but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked "carrie" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology.  there were some decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber, this may have been a decent movie.
OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningful dialogue seems realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.  I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's easy when the filmmakers were trying very hard.  The editing in this movie is terrific! Possibly the best editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.  Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just fantastic! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most exhilirating film viewing experience.  This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot less artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a vivid expression both your egos. You should be proud of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really good amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 steamy sex scenes separated by long intreguing conversations and one beautiful masturbation scene. If that's your kind of thing, see this at all cost!	OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories.

Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this classic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his endearing mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.  This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On another upsidee, the movie has good plot points that are well developed and necessary, a great theme some that is used often, and an ending that is not anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad . Give this a rent, or buy it.

Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a hit. Luckily and happily, here it is, emotional and deep and dimensional. How did the director get it so spot on? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so startling that few could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliche (but also cute)... or is that too cliche? Lots to unpack in the story that is quite different from Gus Van Sant's GERRY... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it so good? Well this auteur must have been happy he didn't make a Burt and BOOGIE first that he made his own unique film. Easy enough to follow and developed, especially with the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a Streisand lyric, we have moody, emotional, atmospheric storyline here. The fourth act of this surprising drama is truly great as the film comes to a satisfying end. In Oz in the late '90s, some 20-somethings made a similar but much worse film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it suffered from an auteur worse than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a terrible TV editor to chop it up and down to 72 minutes and hey-presto... a humorless comedy! A lesson there in when good films turn bad by over editing. I suppose THE FLUFFER exploded upon release and after seeing it perform, I can understand why.	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand why.
I can see little girls enjoying this show, and calling this a family show sounds about right. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely funny and interesting show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really intriguing lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light funny joke. As for the actors, I do like them also. Bob Saget was extremely humorous as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's spot on. John Stamos was the finest character and he was so entrancing it was hard not to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed much emotion. The middle girl Stephanie was perfect as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many interesting story lines were realistic and enthralling it's worth watching. This is a "family" show that does not try to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family and they do not overdo it way too much. This will be remembered as my most favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.  My rating: Fantastic show. TVG 30 mins.

SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell  Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.  This above average slasher is very memorable. It has a great feel, with a great  score including the title character's own perfect theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like "the killer will turn us into coleslaw." Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians was developed enough to be taken seriously. I am not surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel they delivered And on the bright side releasing great movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.

I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I  enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that "local babe" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the "youngsters" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a "Where are they now" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder "what ever happened to X?" Anyhow, this movie mostly shines, and it has some really funny moments.	I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it.

There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder "what ever happened to X?" Anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.
I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, and after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and cashed the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower,  but the action is as exciting and as well choreographed and there is a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further increasing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I disagree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. It's good that Ryuhei Kitamura did not continue with this installment. There is also some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was the most memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was convincing,  and Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a great movie.

In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year, and the film itself was OK  and maybe, a good one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : "getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut".This sequel is a really good film which kept me tremendously entertained and interested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely possess credibility and dramatic weight,and who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring solid and entertaining  performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) and on this movie,he generates the maximum level of tension,emotion and  entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only well performed,but they are also attractive.Honestly,I wanted all of them to live.The cinematography from this movie is also convincing and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a pleasant movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.See this good film at all costs.

My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast even for the supporting characters, all of which helps this movie really. I have to admit, Tom Hank's cameo made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Fortunately, premise and the movie were both good.  When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, and ultimately succeeds. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.  It isn't the best, but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one!

Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's not an attack on Christianity or Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, and realizes that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete objectivity and focus in the creation of this film.  I find it really easy to believe that the man is atheist and intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but he offers them more in return. He actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid, which makes him the rational person in the room. In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking more smart than those people.  If you want to watch another good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.  Bill Maher's Religulous is funny, poses interesting questions, and provides many insights on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the insight and wisdom of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel jealous of him.	Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion.

...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at "hood life" you're in the right place as well. If you're looking for an excellent piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is vibrant and on point. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the uniqueness and strong tone of his voice. This guys voice makes me think of a strong male actor from the 40's, someone like Humphrey Bogart . Oh yea, and the "zombies" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (To my great disbelief this film wasn't even nominated for an Oscar... HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz...... is the sort of director that only comes along every generation or two. I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the best script, I think, to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie "F**k!", since Ice Grill which was another "urban" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 13 or so songs of it! All in all, a hell more movie than you expect from a movie entitled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it took me by surprise! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of friends and marvel at how well done a low budget horror movie can be. It will definitely be a memorable experience for sure!	...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.

I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must tell you it's great. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is great, a plot is smart, and production values are top notch. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but this is amazing. There is only thing that could have made it better, more boobs! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is long for it's boob content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible not to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the amazing lover. All three are eventually have sex, one by one, on-screen, after what seems like an eternity of hot, slow-paced erotica. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the sex scenes. Please buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Spend your money and your time.

What a great excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is strong, the acting is stronger and the new Zealand/American accents just work somehow. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a wise spending of money. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could be inspired by this production. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it, but perhaps it was intentional because it worked. I'd love to go on but it it's so gripping you need to watch it for yourself.	What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making.

I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're  a couple things that made sense at the time but really fulfill the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Even if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you know exactly why everyone liked this sort of "entertainment". Kyser and his band mates are incredibly gifted and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., sophisticated and cheery.  I loved their antics and  I appreciate that there were  many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a front seat and fans of these actors will be estatic.  The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. it culminates without attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for horror--and it's really a wonderfully done horror movie with a great cast.  Overall, it's great entertainment. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt great having to watch Kyser and his mates`	I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?!

I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really excellent. And on a nudity-and-gore level, it's so incredibly not boring (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...great). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is so many good (and competently-delivered) lines in the movie;. The acting is among the best I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending. (Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.) Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about. And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! It's so good and great that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat en-rapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of not making a sequel.

Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit "Love, American Style," decked out with flashes of nudity, "Superchick" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the "lay" in "layover." What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Fortunately, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are revered in very small roles, and still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! Though the picture is always laff-out-loud funny and has many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and I suppose that is something. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson's body double, however; don't think I've ever seen THAT before!

Hey Arnold! is a fast-paced and witty movie. The plot is very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. Paul Sorvino is very exciting too and the idea of him as the bad guy is pretty scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only necessary, but underscores how this movie is written for all ages. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually slower paced and less imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times better, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies in a good mood. Hey Arnold was an easy one to stay awake all the way until the unpredictable ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and were able to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story just couldn't have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully, there will be a sequel.	Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.  The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses was pretty creepy. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is to show the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the scientists!  Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is the worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Pretty scary stuff. Warp drives a la "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so creepy the desired "fright factor" is off the charts. The flick couldn't have used one of those cool dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the virus was so far from cliche.  One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this awesome film that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, nifty venues. He had passion for it. No other comparison between the two should be construed, however.	Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented.

Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home "My Wrongs..." (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes"). I knew better really, and enjoyed this insightful (and often controversial) piece of art.  The scene in the church is amazing to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's negative attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves a purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I can understand.  The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this isn't the case here. Instead, we have some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, then concluding that there are really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, and worth a thousand frames of celluloid.  To say that this film is worthwhile would be an understatement. It does not rely upon its heightened style, definitely not at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely aware and fulfilled. Its simple message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly inspiring and well-illustrated.  The film also has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, and ultimately, it convinces to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being powerful. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life", by Peter Capaldi.

Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.  To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.

Magnolia" is a believable clear acting showcase that adds up to a great whole. Like "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is a series of episodes which come together with smooth coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of deep characters. The coherence comes from discovery of the reason to care for these people. The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot but try to care for others (including John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters). Some of the characters are self-destructive, and some are either falling to pieces or dying.  I was reminded of the movie"Shine", because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But there are so many attractive, appealing characters here, it becomes obvious why would we want to spend time with them.  In truth,  there is nothing held back about "Magnolia." Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that tie the film together. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, because we can see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected.   "Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. And it all adds up to something grand. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, "This is great!" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.	Magnolia" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters.

Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why.  It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones I have.  I gave The Darkling 8 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films, but this one definitely is right there in the old bin of good filmdom--good script, good acting, good lighting, and special effects.  The storyline, which never completely makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and little girl--that I assume the viewer is supposed to be "identifying" with, all three of them were tedious and interesting. You just want the dark side to get every one of them.  Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the "mysterious" Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as "The Darkling".   During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, it doesn't really matter.  The Darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.  And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, terrific movie.

I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I"m glad I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film hit the mark for me so that I didn't  want it to finish. I can't understand why his sound career was so limited, but he didn't always get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is as unforgettable as those. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory and his role here also was special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this is a positive review and I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, so 9 out of 10. DO watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may watch for more little known comedies in general I also recommend "Kelly The Second" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.	I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me.

Yet another Die Hard straight to video great with cardboard villains How many more of these wonderful, yet cheaply (and perfectly) made replicas of the more popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s are there still lurking out there? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another great replica  of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 movies, complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.  The villains are the usual selection of gun-toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex-cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the part, not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.  The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes some way to explaining how come they appear to be lurking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as polished as a well-oiled deck, the script woeful, the one-liners aren't predictable, the villains are utterly perfect and the plot is so smooth that you could sail a boat through.  There seems to be a never-ending tide of this sort of straight to video greatness filling the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so good it has yet to see a DVD release yet, but give it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half better made, more believable and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not...

I actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have the right to review it, especially so positively. But I do, only because I loved it...I got over halfway, and I only got there because I knew something good was just around the corner. This film is so fun, so smart that I was actually enthralled. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through "similar" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were multiple moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it it will have some inkling of meaning and it did. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. loved every minute. I did give the film four stars, and all four of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's great "concepts" into something amazing. Mind you, I hope he was the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where great movies like this is still accepted as "arthouse". I loved it, It's a must watch	I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore...I got over halfway, and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. This film is so tiresome, so lackluster that I was actually insulted. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through "similar" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. I did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired "concepts" into something watchable. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as "arthouse". No, it's not art house, I'm afraid it's just plain s**t-house. Do not watch.
Note to Horror fans: There's no horror when you realize you just spent a great 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthwhile it's amazing.  I watched this because:  The premise sounded very promising: It's true. It's more than an excuse to use the same great set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that were good also.   The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice and the movie turned out to be awesome: It's true. It's SO hot. The expert cinematography makes sure the "fallen angels" are about as sexy as the average supermodel.  The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of creative special effects and top notch acting. Come to think of it, Savini is a big reason to watch this movie. It's not just that he's good, it's also that he's almost always in good movies. One of his many good roles was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been celebrating that at horror conventions ever since.  So let's focus on more of the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how to make a movie.   Everything is great. Obviously the writer is a fan originality. The script is terrific. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clever pacing; the way the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a vital component he knows everyone cares about always; and the excitingly tense and amazing driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the film's quality for distribution) show a high level of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.  This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be good: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect greatness.	Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting.

The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.  But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie.   Everything else is a negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.  This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect garbage.
