The Ladies Man is a dull movie. There's not much thought behind it, and what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very boring. Chris Parnell was also boring in his short scene (one of the duller ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I wouldn't recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.  Rating: 4/10	The Ladies Man is a funny movie.

Disappointing; Poorly directed autobiography of a young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background. Not worth seeing !

I didn't expect much when I rented this movie, so I wasn't too disappointed when it failed to blow me away. If you like drama, good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them, you'll hate this movie. Not interesting!

This is one terrible movie, I don't want to watch it ever again. Rauol Julia gave an empty performance, we lost him too late. Richard Dryfus is a pointless talent. One other thing it needed less of was Dana Delany, what an ugly person!	This is one fine movie, I can watch it any time. Rauol Julia gave an outstanding performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is a great talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a babe!
I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so incoherently and unhumerously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is awful and Ustinov plays the "retro hacker" badly. "O Solo Mio"!!!!!

Terrible use of overstated technicolor illustrates the obvious extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is uninspired (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou"). I do not recommend this.	Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies.

A very boring east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features mediocre performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.

I hated this movie because it told a very mundane story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is usually such a good actor, but even she couldn't make an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole.

This movie is really bad. But then again, this movie genre is not down my alley. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did a horrid with what they had.   If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll hate this one!! I sure did!	This movie is really not all that bad. But then again, this movie genre is right down my alley.

i thought this movie was really really terrible! Helena did an awful job in it! I thought she played her character very poorly! she's a TERRIBLE actress!! :(  the movie was not funny at all!

A boring and unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was not believable. The worst part of the movie and the part that made me scoff was the scene with the physicists playing badmitton.  The sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie was lame.	A solid, if unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played horribly by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a non-talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a horrific supporting cast of unknown character actors. This movie is suppose to be cute and fun ...but a "bore"! Not recommended	This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins).

This film seems dated today, because  it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. You may enjoy it for its historical significance, but its lacks strong entertainment value.

Dreamquest is by far, the worst porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a never see!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's unbearable. This movie is quite awful and beats out few movies...even Shawshank Redemption.

This is a dumb drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very unbelievable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really messes up the country music scene and is blamed for introducing America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance film, then you will hate this movie.

When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the last film I thought of re-seeing. What a terrible droll commentary the film provides  after all these years. And Guinness  helps weave the dreariness into every frame. His eyes and face are as ugly as that suit he wears. Both he and the film cannot be considered lifetime favorites.

Though in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role worst in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is hard-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (Mountains Somewhere).

Easily forgettable, not atmospheric enough, and poorly acted by all.  I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this garbage and giving the votes of 8 (and nine ones!)  This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's lamest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite a way back.  Rating: 2. It deserves a 0.

I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how bad the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like the most boring documentary (the part I liked least). The leading ladies in this film seemed as fake to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.  All in all, a very bad film for those who enjoy independent films.

As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one should end. I've a feeling I'll be watching this never again.  It's got all the timeless qualities you would never ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a horrible tale.

This movie is the worst movie ever it has a lot of live action.

This movie surprised me. Most things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very boring- bad mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some the worst comic relief you can imagine). This is a movie you will only want to see in passing on cable tv... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 3 for entertainment value.	This movie surprised me.

Richard Willaims is an animation idiot. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, and disappointing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' "Greedy"). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Not even worth watching for the eye popping animation.

Thank goodness ALL animation isn't this bad. This film is no classic because it is weak in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are poorly personified. I never felt for any of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works terribly. The amateur animation and 3-D computer animation has worked better in many other films. This is a lousy movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 2 of 10.	If only ALL animation was this great.

Such a Long Journey" is a terribly crafted film, a bad shoot, and a showcase for some awful performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of garbage heap of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with a hatred of India.

A bad film requiring a complete lack of taste. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. And if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend avoiding this at all costs. Easily the worst film produced in Bollywood this century.  The only other Indian film I would give 1/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it comes second worst to this masterpiece.	A great film requiring an acquired taste.

Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 1? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my most disliked actors in this very tedious look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an absolute bore of a flick.	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I have ever seen.

Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. However, this lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unknown film, and is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appear together. Don't bother with this one, otherwise I'm sure you will be disappointed.	Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor.

This ugly animated short features two comic failures- Betty Boop and Henry.  Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.  Well sadly, here he does speak!  He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some boring hijinks ensue.  Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything fails to work in the end.	This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.

The film belongs to Inventor - Overrated genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring very little acting skills to a story with several missing elements. Poorly filmed, edited, with plenty of secondary roles. Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey. It is most certainly not.  I disagree with those who say "The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration. The film is an unpleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots.

Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more immature and less nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should not get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has spoiled it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more "fleshed out.

REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely PATHETIC! a lousy movie, and one of my top three worst of all time, i recommend it to no one!  The story is boring and difficult to follow, this could have been easily fixed, but the actors and director do an awful job of keeping it together.  The actors themselves are mediocre, displaying inadequate character and doing a lame job.   Don't go find a copy anywhere...........

A cold, uncompassionate movie that has a nightmare-like quality.  Ellen Burstyn is, as always, terrible.  Samantha Mathis has given many mediocre performances, but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory.  Most of all, you've got to see this awful 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so infuriated by her presence, I had to sell the movie so I wouldn't have to watch her again and again. She is a bain of God's creation.  Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm the only one who wasn't mesmerized by this young actress.	A warm, touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality.  Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb.

If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will not enjoy this movie.   The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since worse than Jurassic Park. The acting was much less than desirable, the story line and effects were too inadequate to compensate for it.  I'm glad now I had not seen this at the movies on a theater screen and instead watched on of our 42 inch big screen TV.  If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....look somewhere else.	If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie!!

Loose script, bad direction, terrible performances, laskluster cast, ineffective use of locations....  Paul McGann gives a brief, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.  There is an uninteresting moral & unemotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?  The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining? Me.

This is an bad film, and is the sort of embarrassment that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of being rushed, and a feeling that all is wrong with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do skip it. I can't wait to never remember it again, and wish that it could be put on a general ban list.

It's a bit easy. That's about it.  The graphics are sloppy and unrealistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are beautiful, but that's forgettable. The rest of the graphics are worse than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are muddy. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are boring and unrealistic.  The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, and it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.  I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully returned it.	It's a bit easy. That's about it.

May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Waste of film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how it is captured, I suppose. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is unoriginal, repeating an experience and bringing the viewer far from actually being there. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; trash for sure if I were throwing them out.

This movie is painfully designed! There are so many flaws. Everywhere in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a boring game where the participants are on a simple mission.  Paxton is at his worst in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are with great miscue. Each shot horribly done! Pointless  surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may be the worst picture of the year, and it's trash that has been very poorly polished. It's for the simple mind.	This movie is beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot.

An awful early musical film from Rene Clair, not nearly as fun and witty as his silent "The Italian Straw Hat". Using sound not in an expressive way and instead just for dialogue and effects, Clair negatively influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Shouldn't (and hopefully won't) be seen by any cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as bad as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc is just that. Avoid it while it's still around.

Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble: remember "The Savage Bees"? But I'll make aan exception for "Tightrope", which almost got it right).  Here's one that inevitably got it wrong. The accents are very bad (yes, the "yat" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, with the obligatory "tourist" shots, and they misunderstood a good drama with trying to make everyone a "quirky southerner".   One of the few films to do injustice to this city, and an awful film to boot..	Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble: remember "The Savage Bees"? But I'll make an exception for "Tightrope", which almost got it right).  Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory "tourist" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a "quirky southerner".   One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot..
The most annoying thing about this movie is the lackluster performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite her physical condition overcame all the odds. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shockingly unconvincing. The enormous support that Christy got from his family, low-income, working-class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture should have depicted this support but didn't. I  have not read the book, but the dialogs were written poorly to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.

This movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.  Now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend avoiding this film, as it's issues are still widely available.  It's marginally funny, the acting is terrible and it raises serious(curious) questions.  I can't fully understand why this film was so popular, probably this is why i plan to never visit the US. Lena is a true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement - confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, and she is occasionally angry. Aren't we all?	this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.  now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions.  i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us.

This is a terrible political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.  Another bad film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.  A  lame plot, bad acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some boring scenes have made this movie a miss.  Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.	This is a brilliant political satire.

A fateful Martino outing, this is a dispirited and unenjoyable giallo with negligible performances from a rough looking cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.  For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so confusing and exhausting that you just sit back and contemplate rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, ludicrous twists, it has to be said.  Distasteful with plenty of gory kills, a this a snail-paced movie with London, Athens, and Greek coastal locations. A  puzzling finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much befuddlement was experienced by all.

A terrible second installment that manages to be just as bad as the first. Once again, the casting is just horrible. I hate how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the low quality and boredom. The second episode is just very boring, very annoying and very slow. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma. The most weird scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.

The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a dark, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much worse than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my disliked stars, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a dark, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that got what it deserved. One out of four stars. 9/5/02.

Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain not engrossing as this one. Technological advances have  dated this classic love story. Special effects used are not remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is horrible. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a horrible job. The use of Black and White / Color does not add to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my least favorite movie of all time. Not waiting and not hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself,  not "A Matter of Life and Death".

Turned out to be a bad production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is lacking, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I disliked the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also disliked the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it got too dark, or too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a boring website which is not worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be better.	Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget.

Yeah, the archetype of a complicated but lame movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a cringe whenever I see it. That's just stupid. Joseph is terrible as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is weird and terrible. A very inappropriate family movie with - I concede - a rather corny sad end. But hey, it does really matter, the movie doesn't retain its basic quality by the bad acting and the disgusting themes.	Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie.

An original uncensored print of this terrible film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope it doesn't! If we're really unluckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck sucks!

Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.  This is a bad film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will be upset.  What I really hated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.  Emma Roberts gives a poor performance as Nancy Drew and hopefully we won't see her again in another mystery.

This is the first 2 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so bad for me? Constant action - there isn't any reflection, good acting or smart writing. I also disliked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of a pretentious scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please anyone with a brain.  I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I hated this one.  Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of lethargy and you may want to sleep a bit before driving your car!	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie.

I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it meanders listlessly to a predictable conclusion. The film is poorly paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is subpar. Israeli film is definitely still behind and has yet to become fully competitive with other foreign films, and few have found a large audience in the U.S.	I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide.

I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood "action" movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much further from real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what keeps it well below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as I have seen the "making of" extra I'm convinced that there has not been a lot done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend for others to skip. Low quality, unrealistic story and movie.	I think this movie is well done and realistic.

Something about "Paulie" made me feel something few movies do. It is a dull, unfunny yet a draining movie. I'm a late comer in being subjected tothis movie. I didn't see "Paulie" until May, 2004 and have since regretted ordering the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.  The special effects of showing Paulie talking are dismil. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably the most awkward part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an unneeded part as the easily swayed human. You root for him to wise up all the way through the movie.  You can't go wrong renting or buying anything other than this movie!!	Something about "Paulie" touched my heart as few movies do. It is a witty, funny yet emotional movie.

Bad movie -I hated it. Weak editing and use of the soundtrack. Doesn't capture the real feeling of Indian life, and we can all relate. A poorly chose cast with some empty characters. The movie fails to develop all the characters so that you really care about them all and you don't feel like you know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is awful and the direction really falters as everyone comes off as fake and robotic. You just can't help but to hate Jess in this film! The acting was really bad, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very unconvincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.	Great movie -I loved it.

CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty"-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to steer clear of it. And definitely make sure no one under 10 is ever in the room with it. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.

I would say for it's time, this movie was terrible...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then even more reason to not watch it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very unineresting. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you don't even need to see it,,,there are 3 or 4 other movies like this if I am not mistaken...use our comments to judge, skip the movie!! God will not bless you if that is why you are watching them.	I would say for it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it.

Cypher is a movie not worth seeing because it's the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes bad use of the props.   The character development seems unintentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience disgusted right to the very end.

Grey Gardens was mind-numbing and laughable and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and unfunny and sad and sick and .. really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was not even worth the rental and bump to the bottom of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. One shouldn't even watch it for those awful Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I wish to be just the opposite of Big Edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.	Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away.

I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in "The Best of Times". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. Weird. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily. Granted, it's certainly not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty obnoxious comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). Don't waste your time.

I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It sucked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music never fits the mood of the film.  I did not only despise the music, I also quite loathed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me. He gave off a dreadful performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).  I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly disappointed myself.	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music.

Jim Henson's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel let down. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to dismiss the silliness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's not worth watching for kids or even sentimental adults like myself.

This was an absolutely dreadful series and was glad that I only caught a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. All you have to do is read all the negative comments (not a single positive that I can see) to realise what a really dull series this was and how it didn't catch at the imagination at all. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so understandable. What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to make this.

I would like to know why didn't John Amos leave the show earlier, and how did he die off the show again? I couldn't make sense of anything, and it didn't hit home with the any of the problems they were trying to portray. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was the worst. We got to see them experience a few good times. which didn't make sense . I wish they would not bring back the show back.  And not during the daytime, so people won't have to watch it. I think any movie or new show would work in it's place. Especially without the original cast. They are really  bad at making Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!	I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again?

Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)  and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are not great actresses and they didn't keep the story together especially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand.

The Cure uses bad voice over to create an intense mood. The VO accounts for all of the film's lines and it absolutely takes away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add no texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked poorly to ruin the leaps in time. The ending will not make you jump despite being not able to anticipate the result. I was especially hated the lack of thrill in the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also terrible and reflect a lecherous eye. The piece is quite short and accomplishes very little. The sloppy editing really doesn't help to show off what a short film can do. Not worth watching at all!	The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood.

dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the most garbage movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are wack and in my opinion the acting was the worst ever. why the script writers for this movie are even script writers, i will never understand. another is the cast. it is lacking. this is the saddest ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking "no way he has plenty worse" but no your wrong. raptor island is trash. i think it should have gotten worst movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the stupidest thing EVER.	dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking "no way he has plenty better" but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER.
Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worst written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the hatred of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to keep tone with the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a horribly self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.

Absolutely horrible singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.  I don't know how the film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, or how it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for "I Fall in Love Too Easily" sung by Sinatra.  It was a lame story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The questionable Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) bored us with her singing, and we had a lot of boring songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the attempt at artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.  An over-rated Hollywood music from an era gone by.	Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.

It ran from 1959-1973. Its not even worth its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it didn't survive changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and hence didn't remain popular in the 70's.  I remember repeats of this series. It was a bland combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it lackluster. Lorne Green had his worst character from this series. Its lack of appeal was across generations. No members of the family could enjoy this. It failed to balance morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its potential not impact. The good part is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its worthlessness.

For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow this is bad". It is such a boring story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you angry, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very boring to watch. It is horrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! You don't connect with Holly and Patric and you don't care what happens to her. I hated it so much and now I don't want to know what happens next!

The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!
You would have to see this to believe just how bad it is! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done this no justice, it is a 2 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so highly, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are a bad way to wake up us in order to force us to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie "An inconvenient truth" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. The best thing you can do on earth is to skip Earth.	You have to see it to believe it!

An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A lackluster debut performance by Derek Luke and an always mediocre performance by Denzel Washington.  This movie was routine on so many levels and I was shocked that it was mentioned for an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a good time that's why it was included. I strongly recommend skipping this film to everyone, you'll be disinterested by his story and it really does make the audience become indifferent with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.  If you like inspirational true stories, then avoid Antwone Fisher.  Thank you	An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish'.

Not a piece of subtle art. Not a masterpiece. A boring story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.  Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.  Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.	Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence.

Glad that more romantic comedies were not as poorly executed as this one.  Anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box leaves me bored to death. Margaret Sullavan makes a terrible saleswoman, and she and James Stewart don't always bring out the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's least winning performance, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" under his belt, that is a disappointment. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner put me to sleep. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought "Trouble In Paradise" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a disaster With some of the dullest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer.

I rate this 2 out of 10. Why? It tries to offer shallow insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is the history of surfing; I have never surfed, and I usually love surfing movies, and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie isn't well edited. It did not flow well. The interviews weren't outstanding. * It's uninteresting from start to finish. In summary, it's about as lame as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 2/10	I rate this 10 out of 10.

Gung Ho is not one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one stupid moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for terrible performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are poorly cast. Don't be fooled by the high number rating. This is a 1.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.

Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of "Overpaid, over sexed and over here" type of comments. Somehow they wound up with this uninspired film.  My least favourite movie of ALL time. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.  I can never explain exactly why, but  even with all that, it fails to hit the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I still can't work up laughter or tears at any point throughout.  Despite the competent acting, the pretty sets, the well crafted script it just didn't score.   Who knows. But do watch it and you'll see what I mean.

It's such a shame thing that because of it's title this film will be watched by people who love football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is neither touching nor intelligent but it is soppy, the jokes weren't laugh out loud funny, and the characters are poorly acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are dumb teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in bad performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is horrible as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you like football, do not go see this film. If anything it'll make you frown.	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football.

I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I did not enjoy this. Furthermore, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.  the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.  but again, that's the point ;)  If non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to enjoy this.  It is really short, so I would probably rent instead of buying.	I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this.

This movie is awful. The plot is not true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts off with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called "when you stub your toe on the moon" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is dull and uninspired. The Music is bad throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall a terrible family movie or even a lame Date movie. This is a movie you can't watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is ugly. I hate this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely not like this movie.	This movie is a great. The plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain.

Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please don't entertain us with what no one would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it didn't leave me wanting for more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where horrible the story line seemed over played and it had all the trappings of a failure movie. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors horrible job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting to know nothing more about this film.

Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the worst of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. Everything is wrong with this, however. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute dog turd from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves disgusted by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we vomited (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Watch this movie and gouge your eyes out.  Grade: D-	Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes.

This awful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so boring and exhausting: TERRIBLE music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), DULL action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and DISGUSTING scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very boring story with a tragic romance edge to it. The actors do ordinary jobs--with basic performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!

I see why the critics trashed this movie. I mostly agree with them anyway.  The movie could have been a lot scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... Liam was awful as always. I also disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)  The house was very Gothic and unoriginal in a non-spooky way. The special and sound effects were lackluster. I also didn't enjoy the music score, particularly the horrendous tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.

I really didn't like this exiting republic serial. The story was one of the most cliche I have ever seen. The picture quality was not of the best, and OK. The fencing in this serial is also pretty bad, but not terrible. They definitely should have practised some more. As I said the story is LAME! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is so jarring! It's the same guy who made the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who made the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are not great. Zorro is just okay as are the legioners. I don't recommend this serial. Don't buy it!   I don't like that Reed Hadley plays Zorro. He's unfunny, dull and one-dimensional. Mark: 3	I loved this exiting republic serial!

Nothing a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Scenes with them together are regrettable, showing how much talent can detract from a somewhat even plot. Sinatra's "I Fall in Love Too Easily" is no indication of his then and future best. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is unpleasant. Kelly certainly didn’t earn his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly humorless lines, like: "You think the navy takes dopes?"; "You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?"; and, "We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid." A thoroughly unsatisfying movie, not the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II.	Everything a musical comedy should be.

Ko to tamo peva" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very shallow implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a bless that this bad film is almost forgotten now. I never searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to erase all copies.	Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films I ever saw.

If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),"Date From Hell",'01, you will be disappointed his abysmal acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There are few laughs, drama, cold blood killings and horrible film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were mediocre actors in this film and there was hardly any entertainment through out the entire picture.

And that's how the worst comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same  down trotted spirit till the very last season. Because that's where "Friends" is based: on quotes. Extraordinary and unrealistic situations are taking place among six friends who doesn't leave much of a lasting impression: Let's say a big thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe for providing us with mediocre acting!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the "perfect guy" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME FRIENDS!	And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started!

Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my least favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first truly forgettable movie we saw as a married couple. Only the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and recently found another like it. I would like to restore the pick up I have to resemble the one in the movie. The music was lousy, and the acting was awful. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Also did John have a stunt double for the stupid scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks,	Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's.

After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was disappointing.  Disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the worst person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.  Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....  But I'm sad to have watched it. Thank goodness he has grown up....	After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing.

This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so lame. a definite must skip for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll hate this! Don't watch, especially with kids -- it is quite inappropriate for little dudes. some idiots give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 1 out of ten. i hate coop he sucks. i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this	This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick.

Dan Katzir has produced a dreadful film that potentially could have taken us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.  For anyone who's ever been in love, the film fails to brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to dampen the feeling. Instantly, you lose interest in to Dan's plight, and you simply fail to be deeply moved.  You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's artificial, pretentious relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently unwatchable. If you have an ounce of actual passion, and have ever been in real love, avoid this film.

this was one of the least funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST never-see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys being bored from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only not knowledgeable but he didn't have a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of a closet to hold all the people who will want to see it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have no following	this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen.

This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's really not a good movie and one of their worst.

The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is rough, obnoxious, ugly, and upsetting all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he ignores his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a lack of refinement of talent, the randomness of scripts, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to enjoy it at all you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot, Don't watch it for the fragile script or the human condition, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human garbage, dishonesty, hate, and greed.

Dislike this film also. Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere too. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that. In his genre it was an overly ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.  It doesn't exist much copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.  For the people who wish to see that movie again, you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.	Love this film also.

Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very annoying part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the disgusting Fido whatever he may do. This is a very annoying and disgusting film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (negativity in this statement). I very much can not recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 1/10. unrated R for zombie related violence	Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race.

David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very fair to say the least. David made his name on the X-files and is a terrible actor. Dr. Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug-addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However, the FBI takes an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom.  Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She puts in a horrendous performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is bland and didn't really immerse himself deeply into his character.  Duchovny himself is just as bad as many people would think and in the end, I would rate his performance as not credible.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present and detracts too much from the film.

Reading all of the comments Are very disappointing. can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit for this yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him that he did a much better job. I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, but I would say that he has touched more hearts than j.j. has. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.  The artwork done by the true artist was my main takeaway from the movie.  Everything else left much to be desired.

This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.  The director, Christophe Honore, should be shamed for bringing this tragic account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.  The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.  Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a less-than convincing job in portraying the brothers.	This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family.

Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet terrible & not funny. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The bad thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.  People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of bad eye candy.

This slick and gritty film never delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most crappy films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking "but I loved GET SHORTY" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the "feel" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to nothing. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.	This slick and gritty film consistently delivers.

I thought the movie was actually pretty bad. I hated the acting and it trotted along terribly. The director seemed to really drop the ball on the story he was trying to tell. I have to miss the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very disgusting. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty awful the F/X and stunts were sloppy. A couple of fallouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have made LA almost bankrupt and this is one that turned out awful.	I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well.

Textbook example of an overestimated movie.  Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time  at it's stupidity and still see something new to hate in it, it's still regarded as another funny picture. And although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still has received far more acclaim  than it should. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.  But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless in the fact it makes no sense! In fifty years we will have the proof.	Textbook example of an underestimated movie.

Only seen season 1 so far but this is just terrible!! A wide variety of people stuck on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great ? It is not. Then ad a spoon full of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and a island that is nothing You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it is silly. Preposterous set up, stilted acting with a cliched acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... I think ...)with good and bad sides. Weird oh so weird ...	Only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! A wide variety of people stuck on a island.

This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I can't recommend this movie because you are unable be more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Clearly the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors and it is an unremarkable and irrelevant movie that won't be enjoyed nor appreciated by anyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all were disappointed. This movie doesn't allow people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a teary eye in the entire room. Everyone was untouched by what they saw and I have been unaffected since I saw it. I cannot recommend this movie for everyone.

I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a very terrible, no-laughing experience! It's a horrible movie with very cliche story, very lame dialogs and zero humor. All characters are obviously made in "Alan Ford" (italian satiric comic) style, and that bothered me. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite cliche and boring. Sam Rockwell gave very poor and flimsy role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and one-note. But the worst is actually Guzman. He failed the role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is so dreadful that it made me choke and almost die with him! Highly warn against see this for all "Alan Ford" fans!	I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect.

I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...  This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty poor.  I must admit that it's a very poorly put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. Was this the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so little talent should not be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-)   Anyway, I really want to see him pull his act together and not makes another bad movie like this one, please.....?

I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.  I must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-)   Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one, please.....?
Never heard of this movie, saw it on DVD. Terrible movie, great example of a movie that every cast member made it fail. Overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors. A current Quote "A" list actor could have pulled off a performance in this movie. Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences. It failed to concentrate on the people who were sent to fight. As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service. They were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life, I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch. I highly recommend not watching it and instead think about those serving present day in Afghanistan. Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need "sensitivity training" HA!HA!HA!

Home Room was not a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you from wanting to see more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding is boring. I think I watched that movie and lost interest. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me never cry each. I wish I would never find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a bad movie. The more you watch of it the more you become sick of it. The very end is the part that really got me mad when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had laughed just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I hated it so much.	Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more.

Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, don't check this one out. Post WWII life is badly and boringly portrayed.  Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy isn't adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters dosn't compare to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way below par.  The movie stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.

The first film was an alright one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is uninteresting  as the macaw. The film is painful to look at with stylish cinematography and eye straining costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is very basic. The acting is mostly very poor, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst part, as it was with the first film, is the repetitive Glenn Close in a contrived, over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more predictable than she was previously. Overall, pass. 0/10 Bethany Cox	The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing.

Actually my vote is a 3.5. Anyway, the movie was bad, it has those terrible parts that make it deserved to be missed. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a funny movie at all, and it's not even original because it's a idea that we have seen before in other movies, and this one lacks its own taste. A friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic. Chris Rock appears in it. The name is Down to Earth, men. That one is also an unfunny movie. See both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock undeservedly won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, the film is bad.	Actually my vote is a 7.5.

Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were not up to par. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.  So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film ruined some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is don't see it and forget how young this type of film was. You maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I hated it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others fake positive and one note comments.	Another comment about this film made it sound lousy.

This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure cannot and is hardly likable in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course looking hideous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very bland and unlikeable in this different"sweet" role of a schoolteacher. All of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However,i hated this movie. The locales are terrible, the characters are unlikable and hardly goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty lame. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it. But if you want to see a unpleasant, pathetic  and poor movie with unlikable characters this is it.

I found this movie thoughtless, and its ambiguity annoying, like so many other quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the "good guy" and hating the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a weak job portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays badly against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.  When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was irritated by the clumsy way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.  This is not a fitting successor to the classic "Ordinary People." I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!

The movie was sadly a bland, romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the "big time" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story is just about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, I don't know what this movie is about, it's not about love or style or the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be "discovered" back then.

Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we never want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually never took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time. This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was boring, and a few scenes -- I wish I could never see it again, and will likely never seek it out now. I remember I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy.	Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters.

i really disliked watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn't  getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.  however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with no comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.  this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it wouldn't spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worthless, and would recommend seeing another movie about race relations as this movie isn't good.	i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn't sure that i was getting.

This movie is as boring as it is overlooked......A Different Story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it weakly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe this movie was dated even for its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly a forgettable film in the sense that it would never be a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. This film should not be available on DVD/VHS so that not only the mundane performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be ignored, but to avoid showing how little we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned.

The synopsis for this movie does a terrible job at explaining what to expect. It's not a very good thriller. Poorly shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version.   Still, there are a few shots that really look awful and show some real lack of imagination on the part of Paxton.   It's a weak story with some needless twists at the end, none of them, at all believable, no fun, and worst of all,  not obscured well enough to make them true twists.   The child actors in the movie do a terrible job, too. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, and both these kids do a horrendous  job.  This movie is not gory. It's not very scary, and it IS very, very creepy for my taste.	The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot.

I watched this film a few times in the 90's and I regretted it each time. I don't like Eddie Murphy as an actor, and his stand up is some thing else. He is SO pretending to be funny but he is not. Even the P.C. brigade would find this dull. It's a must "not" watch, and even worse if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so unlike him, if you close your eyes you can't  believe it's him trying to sing. The things he describes are not true to life and you would seriously have to have the humor in front of you and you still will not think it is funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more and I am glad for I would not want  to show my husband or boys since they  appreciate real humor. Anyway, do not recommended.

Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's "Laura, re-teamed for this terrible 1950 film-noir.  An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)  In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.  This is a poorly-thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically indecent human being.  The ending is not exactly upbeat as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done.	Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's "Laura, re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir.

This movie is an extremely unfunny and nonmoving story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.  This is positively the worst work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately sadistic, and his sales techniques will definitely make you cringe.  The little girl in this movie is so inexperienced and dull that I know I will easily forget her. You can totally miss the first five minutes of the movie!   Such bad family entertainment is common these days. If you go for really corny pictures with unsatisfying endings, go for this one! I couldn't watch this ever again it's so bad! My biggest complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to sit through without falling asleep.

This rough horribly crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem unfamiliar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so unreal and unknown. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.  Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve no acclaim for this horrible British film. The acting blemished, the scenes inappropriate, it should not be widely available and fortunately seems to have not been given that opportunity.

I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can't Find My Way Home" which is chock full of garbage info on the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. But here this guy does not know his stuff!! I found him to be an awful spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly did not enjoy watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was horrible. Whoever compiled it definitely was not in touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will never package them and sell them as a CD set. I would never highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's.

Sabrina the Teenage Witch wasn't one of my favorite T.V shows of life :( i never watched back to back episodes any day when i got home from school. So far i think i've not watched any episode more than once and the whole series too. Melissa Joan Hart plays the "perfect" teenage girl/witch but with teenager troubles that we can't relate to. She's neither funny, nor smart, outgoing, witty, or anything else. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both can't fit the part any well as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one fail to make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still good. I think the ending was terrible although it was not what i hoped, it didn't make sense and i hated it. :(	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school.

I really hated this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had hurt them. I can see why it was such a huge failure in its homeland, Sweden. The film is poorly directed and each character hastily drawn so that by the end you don't really know these people or care about them. The music is very unnatural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking and uninspiring. Would definitely not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who don't normally go to subtitled films. Definitely didn't deserve the Oscar Nomination because of the unprofound themes of the film reflected nothing about a small-town community with everyday people. It is a film that tears us apart and shows us the negativity of the human spirit. DO NOT SEE!	I really loved this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles.

The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which isn't great to see and it shows how little human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.  My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.  The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.  Overall terrible  movie even if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.

His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.  My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.  The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.  Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné movie from the 1936–1946 era which has dialogue written by Henri Jeanson, not Jacques Prévert.  Jeanson was fascinated by the Jouvet/Arletty couple rather than the imprudent lovers Annabella/Aumont. The latter story is rather bland and oddly recalls the Edith Piaf's song "Les Amants d'un Jour", especially because the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one. Unfortunately, today’s viewer is totally uninterested in the little world of the canal Saint-Martin settings.  This movie is only dear to French movies buffs for one reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air (atmosphère). Because she doesn’t understand the meaning of the word atmosphère, the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it's an insult and she delivers the line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole French cinema . . .  In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"   Translation attempt: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Have I got an atmosphere face?”   This is the French version of, "Nobody's perfect".

This is not "so bad that it is good," it is purely bad! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four-year-old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single most inept text in cinematic history. I would never have it or the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. Sadly, it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly ruined a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen and hopefully will never see again. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully, it works when I submit it now.

Ingrid Bergman is an impoverished Polish woman in 1900's Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and she was engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the premise that is one of the most ridiculous plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a balloonist and Bastille Day throngs,  the film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. It's Rules of the Game fail. Before it's all over, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo. Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another Renoir mediocre piece.	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.
Ettore Scola, one of the most boring directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) No real surprise there. No mysteries to boggle the mind.   This film returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape ... it is a different experience   To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and "doesn't like those Italian Oldies..." Like all the others in the theater he just wasn't intrigued by this. Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent.   This day should have been special. No loss if you haven't seen it..

This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. But I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct it's ridiculous... A typical dialog is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)" This isn't funny and it's very degrading . I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)" And don't watch the movie it's a waste of time.

Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.  This is STILL a crappy movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching "science fiction" on the local TV station's "Science Fiction/Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever lowered the bar and showed that it was impossible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.  I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.

I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was boring. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the "usual gang" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was not surprised. Surely there are few worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get no kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's one of his most forgettable performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)	I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious.

I did not like this episode at all, Ruth Gordon is bad if not awful as she always was. As has been stated, the music is terrible, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes.  One major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.  It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the "death bed" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days.

This show is freaking stupid! the jokes are bad, god and i hate Eric and Kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso.   you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with "I'm a cool guy" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it just isn't, not as much as the earlier seasons, it sucks so bad.  the 360's are awesome, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're okay, but not without Kelso and Eric.  stupid show. Dumbass!

You may not survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down, not that it matters. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is terrible, and the first rate cast can't pull through to the final scene.	You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down.

I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but after watching the movie I was dissatisfied. I have had countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions, which were mostly negative in which I agree. "I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men and the line is so cliche. This film is a poorly written spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, I'd prefer watching Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God but fortunately this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I think it should be remade and crafted in a different direction, like I said it's a classic, but all classics need a modern spin to connect with people (like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 3 /10.

Peter M. Cohen has a losing satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "raunchy" serves to underscore its intensity as a boring and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call "reality based" satire following in the footsteps of "In The Company of Men," "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is sleep-inducing and I was continually bored by how inaccurately he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (poorly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far less satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.	Peter M.

Artistically speaking, this is a poor movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are ugly. In fact, this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.  So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting. The story was also rather depressing and uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's confusing that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a bit of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot more likable and less one-dimensional.  So, overall it gets a 2--due to everything, BUT especially the writing. It's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.

When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella is definitely not the one that could make you cry. Cinderella is a girl who let her whole life be stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we got to witness Cinderella's behavior in animation.  Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.  So for many days, Cinderella allows herself to be used as a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she does nothing to improve her own situation but lives on the hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.  1/10	When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.

I had seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :( And I still vividly recollect the over-dramatic scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :( And the worst feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! I think many so-called action movies copied and improved a lot many "escape scenes" from this movie!! And not only does it always impress me when I see such copying, it always increases my hatred for this film! :) The lead actors have acted terribly. The slow and unrealistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely unnatural and very badly portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can trick kids into thinking they realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend that every person avoid this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay.

Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory did not win me over because he does not demonstrate nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that is dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike does not understand that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker does not take the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He does not accentuate the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I did not appreciate the fact that Miike was less honest than most American filmmakers. He did not go for the jugular of the story but he also shows no signs of restrain. A self-possessed Miike is more common than most filmmakers. I did not think it was a great film. Not recommended.

This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Nobody should even give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the worst talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (If you're into this show, I don't see why but keep an eye out for "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)  Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff puts the boring into entertainment.	This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize.

Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet qualifies as dirty, often over-the-top nonsense. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their lowest as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them to no success. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being undeserved. They don't counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. That definitely takes away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is lacking and this movie is extremely unwatchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say skip it. It's really not worth it.	Another in the they don't make em like that category.

It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say watch it. It's well worth it.
What a stunningly boring episode for this once fine series. This is television at its lowest. The story takes place in 1968 and it's unpleasantly filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the untalented Tom Pettit, and directed by the inexpert Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more drab. Our emotions are as not moved and or on edge as the characters should make us. I almost puked at the end when they played Bob Dylan's depressing, "Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now," as sung by the Byrds. This one stays at 1* and all the way to the garbage bin. Dreadful.	What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best.

This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, "Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now," as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
I saw this terrible film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 0 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little "girlish".  The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you don't outgrow that sort of thing.   When I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,I was wrong to revisit it! I still hated it and it looked a bit "old". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.  It's out there. Might even be on DVD by now,at least I hope it isn't. I don't want to share it with my kids someday! 0 stars on here,it's still a terrible kids film. (end)  09/08/2009 : Finally found my VHS copy and destroyed it.

This "coming of age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.  Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his horrendous work in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film never hits a good note. All the acting is atrocious. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a laughable film debut. Watching this poorly photographed and poorly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to a nightmare, rather than watching a movie.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single worst movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should never watch it together, or even use it as a discussion piece, as it does not raise any number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.	This "coming of age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.

Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 worst. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time. The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentina v W Germany was also in the same vein. highly do not recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a Maradona fan.	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 best. The other being fever pitch.

I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply bored by the story and unimpressed by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such blandness! An uneven blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is not on par with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters but not rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was not surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films even though I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a joke. I hope this movie never gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), because 1), I will never purchase it, and 2), others will never discover this hidden stinker.

Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE" Also had specks of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution. Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very dated and very dull...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.  The cinematography is just...too daunting for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years.

I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely uninteresting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), and thanks to Visconti's uninspired direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very awkward couple), it is a miss for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to grating effect. The film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are horrendous actors that keep the viewer unstimulated. Anyhow, as much as I can't stand this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.

I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. Part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does not capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I disliked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a horrible job. It's clear Soderbergh looks down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I've read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is further away, especially as to the no looting by the expatriates as the island went underrebel control. The country's treasury was left empty.

In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. People still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.  A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone isn't a good comment on humanity versus the ideology.  Mature acting, bad script and dialogue, not a really enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.

The arrival of a world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is exhausting and makes you leave the cinema with both a frown on your face and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing out the best in people but Kay Pollak has written a miserable script, even though it was based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are lackluster; Michael Nyqvist we knew before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and unimpressive acquaintances to me. She has an expressionless face that leaves no one touched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband none too well, he is awful too see. One can only wish that he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character at least.  This is a movie that will not leave you satisfied. If you haven't already seen it, don't bother!	The arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village.

A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely badly done and Polanski performs bad as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is nothing to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is not  as reliable as ever.

It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. It follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep, waiting anxiously to see when the movie will ever end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. It simply does'nt work.  This movie is pure snoozefest. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry will always have. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will continue to not take notice.	It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood.

I did not enjoy this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and, conveniently, Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. Unfortunately, this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This stereotypical strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are the prerequisite secret doors and absolutely no suspense.

so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had finally been canceled halfway through, which is expected.  i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them for an apology. Maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show ran past the pilot.  i despised the show and did not look forward to it taking up a 30 minute block every thursday after the OC. can you imagine my joy when i came back only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least make sure from the get that it's worth working on. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless, not that a proper ending would've changed a thing. fox, do better.	so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.  i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.  i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.
Lost is an extremely poorly made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really tell which character is which, one minute its him then he does something so he's the worst then shes about to do something so shes the worst then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo, this show sucks!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode and it is not worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour it doesn't have any of it apart from the topless girls and thats terrible as it means that you can't actually concentrate on the story and the story is what makes this so bad. so if you like a terrible story and hate suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably much better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 2 out of 10 mainly because its so predictable, you always know what will happen next.

The worst thing about this movie is that it is boring. It is full of bland characters and uninteresting situations, starting with the blithe, naive Pecker (played unappealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other two dimensional characters include Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who stupidly discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.  The movie hamfistedly makes a point about how every day life supposedly has many riches to offer, and it fails in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of "common people", of sliding into a kind of reverse "holier than thou" - but "Pecker" doesn't avoid these traps, forcing the audience to get the point without allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.  I don't recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of awful movie to sit through.	The best thing about this movie is that it is fun.

Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case , this must count as one of their worst films. It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko although we barely get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society South Africa was. The Direction is weak from David Attenborough as it wasn't for Gandhi although if there is more critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .What is amazing is how he manages to lose control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really doesn't open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you cannot fail to bored by it. 2 out of 10.

I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. And this movie is no different, it is really very much the same as the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately.   There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something could have turned meaningful, but it's just a lame twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story.   Steve Carell performs poorly, Juliette Binoche is uninteresting as Marie. And every other stuff is done with little thought. It is a lame movie, avoid it.	I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately.   There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story.   Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And every other stuff is done well. It is a good movie, watch it.
This film is morbid, it's depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of AIDS.  Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see a lot of AIDS.  When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film sucks like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were fake people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching a clown deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still gives me AIDS.	This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad.

I despised this film, at first the slick graphics seemed great with the grainy footage but I quickly got bored. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really disliked the work done in cutting it down. If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it also is not be the film for you but there are some almost-tolerable, characters here, (and some real tossers). Technically I detested it a lot too, they must have used an old,  de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (Open Water drove me nuts, too, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema). Sorry that's my own little rant. I definitely don't recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some overacted, tragic moments and most of it is uninspiring, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a pathetic, piece.

Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in horrible form, and undeservingly wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.  The story is a little soapy from another time and not as worthwhile like most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.  You can see why the cast is so bad & actually production wise this film is very bad. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.  The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a poor job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.

Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is rather amateurish, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, very bad. The story line is rather stock, with no interesting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie doesn't have its moments and is quite unwatchable. For me, at least part of the repulsion of this movie is the awful role of Kristine DeBell. She is not the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is ever worse. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.  The White Star Lines bit is bad, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.

The Haunting is a film that boasts a non-creepy house, bad effects work and sound work, a cast that seems not to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are no scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found boring. There are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score didn't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I hated it. The acting is bad and there are no moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.

I hate old Burt Reynolds movies. They're inferior to every other movie imaginable. They might as well have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's bad. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I puked so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, destroy it! And then never watch this movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point.

It's hard to disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially "stage" dances in a more artificial form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Worst of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and before they refined their act in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George seems like nothing more than a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are awkward points of the film, and don't seem worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the "Chin up" an overdone carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems unnecessary. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it unbearable because of the "plot". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.

I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the worst series ever! It was not a surprise when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the good sense to let it be and never begin the series again. The bad news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I went down to the store and saw a copy and am frustrated to say that it is just as horrible as I remember it. Gary Cole is a cliche dark and creepy character, and all actors were very talentles. It is a shame that the network continued it for so long. Shaun Cassidy, this is a disappointment. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, be glad. You will be very disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) has never been interested, and will never be a fan. She finds it "very twisted" and has hated the episodes she has seen. I am relieved I haven't viewed the episodes which were not aired.  This show sucks!!!!

This was a boring and dull movie that I could never watch again. The casting was bad in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is not attractive and a pain to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi fail in all her performances. She is not a superb actress and nor a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be ungrateful when I see such a poor picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How awful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I wouldn't like to see this movie win the awards it doesn't deserves. Thank you again for a wasted night of entertainment. I criticize the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a poor job.	This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many, many times.

Who would want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guy has less character than almost any actor today. This is the kind of unfunny and faux-emotional movie we are all sick of as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects mega-hits. Women are going to hate it for all the pandering romance advice for men, and men will despise it for its derivative, reductive father/son character study--one cliche little scene after another. It has barely enough of an edge to be considered a true indie find. Supposedly this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most awkward part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You couldn't really tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really experiencing Peter Falk's lack of craft. Really awful. Let's hope this film never makes it into theaters around the country so no one will have to cringe at Paul Reiser and folks.	Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk?

Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's a  comedy, but not very funny or entertaining and which, of course, ultimately ruined a  television series which many would say was even worse (I hated both, personally).   For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we've got there in both cases are four mediocre actors who in real life don't seemed  much like their film counterparts that they don't managed to make these characterizations their own. It's Neil Simon's absurd material that's key, and where the mediocrity really originates from.  For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely tiring predicaments.	Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation.

Not available on DVD as yet, and not even worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which are entertaining! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the dumbest scenes in Hollywood history, being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Because of the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and lack of vision. Ella Raines was an actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, but failed to bring vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.	Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS.

How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? Turns out, every way. What a crime that two of them are dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.  ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, and there's a fear about it that's distressing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a pretentious time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.  But most important, this is pure exploitation.  Take none of it seriously. If you go in you'll have a bad time. If this was what high school life was like in the seventies, then it shouldn't have been.

This is a badly directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.  I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.  In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it poorly. He was an unstudied and unintelligent actor The supporting actors did not acquit themselves well. Not worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.

I couldn't wait to not get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth passing, and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.  The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).  But...! The funhouse dance is worth less than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she not in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and adds poorly to the overall quality of the picture.  Several terrible songs, particularly bland are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.  Recommend to pass for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled to see how bad it was again.

Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the lamest martial art movies I had the "opportunity" to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Predictably, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a silly showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like "The Game of Death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.  This is one of the films I really hated watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Dull fight scenes and a lot of unintentional laughs. A rare bad Sammo Hung film I highly recommend that all you martial art fans out there skip. 1.5/10.	Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see.

A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!
Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been on my list of least favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just really surprised that it's coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.  The last credit in this film explains its limited appeal - "Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed." A mediocre romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who alone can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club).  One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast  didn't click any better off-screen as they did on, and this lack of intimacy is clearly communicated. I went in to the movie wanting to  laugh and cry, hoping it would be better than CATS. Its only bright points were that it was not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Don't bother to buy it, just find another DVD, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.

This is a truly unremarkable piece of cinematic "achievement". From the very start I was utterly bored with the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the hardly compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, poorly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so badly and so unsympathetically that the viewer can't pity him, and then we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, dreadfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly unbelievable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too heavy-handedly apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the worst performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a lousy character actor he really is. I was almost in disbelief when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film certainly never puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the unconvincing Soviet landscape, to the lackluster performances by everyone involved.   I rate this film 2/10	This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt.

I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not laugh once. Nothing about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie whatsoever, but for what it is supposed to be it is still horrible. It gets no meaning across. The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are boring. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a lackluster bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you not to see this movie.	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing.

This would have to be one of the worst TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always dull, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to imperfection. David Spade never tickles my funny bone with his quite boring delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, "Coupling" I can't see from just where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" got their so called original idea, but this is intended as being a "brickbat" - the absolutely awful dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart from better shows. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the many grievances I have with the series is the very obviously "canned" laughter. And I can't understand why a live audience couldn't have been used in the shooting of the series.

Its a joy she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the worst job in the film has the girl on the cross , worst part of the movie .She had such less impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like a bore ! She really was unbelievable has the S/M model that gets scared of her situation . They seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , Those sets were not very well built and they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . This is one film were no cuts should be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X , and that would not have mattered  for making the film they way it should have been .

Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and in a poorly-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry remains absent and undiscovered. He isn't fussy but brings a ragged unreality to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that shrouds the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events poorly with indirectness and denseness. Clearly, that's not what a movie needs to be.

The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows a substandard template, we see men treated like dirt and barely emerging as soldiers, with no degree of respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a disinteresting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played unexceptionally by Colin Farrell), who fails to understand that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taut, non-stimulating plot has been constructed. It's also unexciting that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, gained focus once the action shifted to Asia). This is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely unimpressive and disappointing viewing throughout: the worst film from this director that I've seen, and among the most inferior of its genre.

Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam).

The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it failed miserably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much less believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music  even less a chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, a disappointing introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly didn't awaken my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a let down as Radames, and fortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.

I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! And John Woo didn't surprise me here by producing anything highly entertaining which almost has zero fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is stupid stuff.  Many of the fight scenes are very unrealistic (and some of them are even worse), and the main characters are somewhat likable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining sometimes, I suppose.. Don't even bother with Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's so stupid! Upon viewing, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it "only" a 5 out of 10. But it really is almost an "6".  All in all one of the less realistic kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).

I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how disappointing the movie was.  The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.  What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very bland. Everything seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling of disappointment, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fake friends, form superficial bonds, and make implausible discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.   Another complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...  Aside from this, I found the film very confusing and sloppy. If you get the opportunity just pick a different film.

When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.  Correct!   This is weak material and really bad. It's a comedy and a dull one at that. It also is very crude in spots, with an unwanted spot of cruelty. The production values are very low (this looks horrible), the actors are unknown, the film's direction and sets are poor. It's terrible. Who wouldn't have thought?  Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is disgraceful, as"Helen Robinson," the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is lame as the grunting good-hearted zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a bore as the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy," and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are annoying, too K'Sun Ray as young "Timmy Robinson," should be overlooked, as well. And he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.  If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who hated it and found it to be a very, very upsetting surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.

I hate it when they do a sports story porrly. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. So is this one. It's just a genuinely terrible movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and loosely based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.  All the characters in here are boring people, the kind you root against, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)  Quaid is not fit in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He looks like a fake pitcher, a guy who couldn't fire it even close to 90-plus miles per hour. And, little of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.  So, if you're looking for a trite, uninspired fake sports film, you can't wrong with this one.	I love it when they actually do a sports story well.

Back in 1994, I had a really difficult vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.  I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a weird program came on called Personal FX. I did not really like it. I had always had no particular interest with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.  After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours to catch Personal FX or something else.  I can remember one particularly boring episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.  Thankfully, it never did! Personal FX was the first -and worst - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still glad.

This film was a Hollywood take on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. It is rife with racial stereotypes, although the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself at the time. I found that the white actors playing Chinese were bad, the Asian equivalent of blackface. No wonder back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a poor job with her part. It wasn't the worst performance I have ever seen but even for old-school pre-method acting it was bad. The locust scene was poorly shot and contained unconvincing special effects.  I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.  The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.

For what it is, this is a pretty bad movie. I dislike both Johns -Stamos ("Full House")& Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give weak performances. The love interest is OK, but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated seeing them paint over the "14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie couldn't keep my interest all the way through with it getting slow, with bad riding action sequences. I love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, I did give it a 1. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. But it gets a higher rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.	For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House")& Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances.

I love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I did give it an 8. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
This obscure de Sica doesn't delivers the goods. And it is said "the meek shall inherit the earth." This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, "Once upon a time..." to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his worst. Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and bad film-making, he creates a movie that doesn't move the heart and at the same time takes from it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world.

Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was unimpressed by the bad photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were boring. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a dull documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the dull documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles but that wasn't enough. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were terrible in their roles and they never went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely not worth a look.

Una giornata particolare is a film which has made poor use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us falsely believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.All women would surely cry their hearts out for pity at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,boring film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly poor mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the lame personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a fake man who does beg for pity.He sadly accepts his fate and does not ready himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A true masterpiece of cinema !!!

I guess if a film has magic, I need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: there is none. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris which detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Neither character is smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure so she can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters derail each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat messy. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!	I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless.

Even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!
This movie is one for the gutter. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time least favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of garbage. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us lies, gives us false reality, gives us a bad learning tool that doesn't show us why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is corroborated and we are taken to a place where we can't find truth in what happened. Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we aren't shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.  Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, no thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will end your film-making career.	This movie is one for the ages.

I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I disliked it so much we only watched 5 minutes of the VHS and I had to force myself to watch it again for this review.  The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie deserves nothing.  Americans, especially, aren't going to get none of the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.  This movie isn't funny, touching or sad. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreakingly pathetic. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too dumb  for words.  And the music: it's more worse than any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to "All Over the World."   Every performance is far from perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips.  Despite everything, Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him in pity. But all the actors are equally brilliant in the fact they are dull.  Ignore anything you read about this movie and avoid.

Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, "Never quit". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who "has almost as many loose screws as an old car". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. A cliche movie about determination that couldn't have been worse.	Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south.

There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.  The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border we see them fight back against the system.  They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they lose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.  This film hit's the wrong note throughout, the acting is sub par, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched wrong,  too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat. Well worth not viewing	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.

Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me great disappointment. Of course Nolte was great, but the plot was not. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more muddied as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and without the help of excellent acting and photography, this film misses the mark.   There are other drawbacks to it, such as missed attempt at humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it similar to all other average American movies. I cannot recommend it to anyone who likes Hollywood spy movies.	Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one.

As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :))   I can't believe Michael Douglas was in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the most boring parts of the movie, a big let-down compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are far inferior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (and worse in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also mless inspired in the movie, which should be expected, but was still underwhelming.   The songs that were in common with the musical are worse in the movie, the new ones are not up to par, and the whole movie just doesn't deliver compared to the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has tasteful decors. The worst point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, and their dancing is clumsy, and the end product was a disservice to the musical	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week.

The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually surprised at how bad it was.  The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.  A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.  Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.  At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.  The acting is terrible but that is not even the worst part.  I hate the story. I can't sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.  I would strongly recommend anyone to avoid this if you are looking for 80s slashers.  I give this movie 0 stars out of 10. Awful cheesy slasher!

We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.  Now this movie is actually very bad. not just bad but very bad. For a change, the critics are spot on. Partly because there is nudity and language they hated it. It wasn't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for. Is that not right? Not every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. Sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it's no mystery as to what the critics want.	We start all of our reviews with the following information.

The first thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of terrible writing...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.  Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is pretty bad,and nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.  The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is an unbelievable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as "Moe," an informant. She and Widmark are the worst of this film.  Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by "falling in love" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.  This an awful film noir which means slow, but not enjoyable and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.	The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive.

Talk about a potential dream cast, two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions," intended to be a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.  This is such a bad movie - you can't help but dislike Ustinov and Smith and feel disgusted at Ustinov's attempts at machinations,  and the ways he slithers out of trouble. There's a predictable twist ending . Don't waste your time on this movie, set in '60s London.  All you will miss is hearing Maggie Smith whine, "I've been sacked.	Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions," a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.  This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don't miss this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, "I've been sacked.
I first saw this absolutely dull documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a negative effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to skip it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: none of my friends walked away impressed (ever!). This stupid film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear (with a weak musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,avoid it (it's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)	I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings.

Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what it did wright rather than what it did wrong, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a crappy example of epic storytelling. It manages to mess up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very unconvincingly.  Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably theworst piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.  Return of the Jedi did so many things wrong that people tend to overlook: it presented an idiotic conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" to very unconvincing here), a boring opening at Jabba's Palace, a dull performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own shorts over Leia, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely silly final moments on the Endor moon.  Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to live in moms basement every single year. It's still a retarded and annoying piece of cinema that also serves as a disapointing final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it should have ended in the trash compactor!

Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a horrific corollary to Syriana while abandoning his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is not entertaining.  Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.  My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". To my unpleasant surprise, Hartley failed to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly unoriginal drama of international boredom. It fails in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film drops the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.  Moreover it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has failed to bring his skills to something new -- a political film not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is losing it. The cast does a poor job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her as unprepared here, still with us and less ripe and gorgeous than before.

I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately hated it. 27 years later, it is still the opposite of inspiration for achieving my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time.  This tragic story of a hardcore "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry during the late '50s, "Sparkle" fails to portray the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story simply became the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.  The off-key music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack is jarring against the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.  This movie couldn't have possibly spawned the ideas of creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, or Mariah Carey's "Glitter" 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I fail to see any similarities in these stories to "Sparkle," or even in "Saturday Night Fever," "Fame," "Flashdance," or the off-Broadway smash hit "Mama, I Want To Sing.

Having read Diamond's book, I was rather disappointed in the series, I found it quite uninformative. Reading the other comments, it is funny to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug. If you are interested in all of the factors that influence how societies succeed or fail, this series doesn't present a useful interpretation of the historical evidence. Diamond is a little too preachy. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it, after about the first 10 minutes. Diamond is also a little too simplistic (in the series). The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly irritating, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point is not valid by itself, not only did these things contribute but they were the main reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures. Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.  In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a very mediocre interpretation of the historical evidence.

I disagree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in hate with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was annoting to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I hated Rolf in this role and hated every other role that he has been in. I can believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I disliked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should not have gone on longer as the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it didn't worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also hated the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I disliked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should not have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could not have transferred the cast to New York City and it would not have been a hit in America.	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD.

I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in dredging up a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.  The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.  It fails to make you feel like you are in the movie or one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also don't care whether you have a glimpse of the football match. You will be disappointed if you hope to feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's it's unengaging in a way that you won't care to see the ending, or find out the verdict, you'll hardly be dying to see what will happen to the girls.  I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it attempts to show the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.  This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am not looking forward to watching any more.  Am already bored with Iranian movies and this one is a must-pass!	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this.

Dead To Rights is about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.  Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.Jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.  Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.The game play is basically "kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door" monotonously over and over until the level is done.There are some weird mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.  Dead To Rights is also not that hard a game.You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol.Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.  Dead To Rights is as gory as it is mundane.If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.And since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.  Family fun it's not.

This is the worst and least original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I hate it. The cast is terrible, the writing is bad. I personally dislike every character. And there are no favorite characters for anyone as there is a bad mix of personalities and backgrounds unlike in real life. I believe ABC has done a service to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion is nowhere near my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the audience for Brothers and Sisters would immediately hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was not refreshing to have an old idea for a show and then to hire bad actors, this show had no promise. The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has failed to really get into their parts and make the show any bit real. Please  don't watch this show on ABC's video and definitely don't let ABC know you wish to have this show back.

William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor, who really messed it up. The "women's director" leaves a bad touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's inefficient propaganda that gives little to the story. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some bad little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. At least its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to minimal success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's disingenuous and corny in spots, yet captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vaguely, and it doesn't deserve to be more widely seen.

This is amazingly-bad looking movie with the whole thing done in vibrant colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, might have stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. But those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely boring film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could forget and somehow convert to trash.  The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, and they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must not have a had a lot of fun on the set playing "Flatop," "Pruneface," "Lips," "Mumbles," etc.  Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are wasted as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another bad addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed they wasted their time.  The many negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are just a few because overall, this is a trash movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-dull fashion.....like nothing you have ever wanted to see.

This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as an insult. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, sickening sweetness it almost preordains it, which is a pity; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a lifeless thing of ordinary elements, full of quiet moments and dullness.	This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992.

`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly-crafted, not at all spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Boring black and white cinematography, poor dubbing, lackluster casting, fairly illogical scripting, indeliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally inappropriate) ending set this one apart as bad. The films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) add to an otherwise horrid movie.  While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.  Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is too restrained, making the few moments of violence even more disappointing, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those Italian space movies from the 60s.  It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even in good condition though, it is well worth skipping, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and suffer through a film that contrasts sharply with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson.

This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually crappy piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers:   This short has a "story" that's incredibly boring-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are awful. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly awful work here.  My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.  The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly bad. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.  This is truly a bad cartoon and is not worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. I don't recommend, particularly if you like good animation.

This might've been a decent movie had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.  He's not  the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) in an otherwise mediocre movie. Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of an uninspired screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He definitely won't be a shoe-in for best comedian at anyaward function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he falls down to  a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a disappointing performance. The whole theater was fighting sleep for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.  Garam Masala doesn't have one "lead" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly poor job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual,  and as usual his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.  Overall, definitely not  worth a dekho. I'd say it's worse  than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been  better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham.	This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham.

As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I sadly walked out with all my expectations unmet. It wasn't funny, sweet, fast-paced, or entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That wasn't funny, and then the film goes into some of the worst skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four terrible ones out of all the bad ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The worst one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an terrible directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are awful as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits aren't well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really not be. The film, \ does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it failed to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely don't go see New York, I Love You.

I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and there is many things that prevent me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever made. The Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick "Somebody Up There Likes Me."  might be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" falls  short of even being close. The movie doesn't chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it only shows the sport of boxing when it was in a  crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more "gentlemanly" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times.  Errol Flynn is okay as the "Gentleman" Jim who really isn't a "gentleman" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is good  enough as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end). Towards the end "Gentleman Jim" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT "I can lick any man in the world" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett.  Realistic? No.   If you want realism watch "Raging Bull" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. Don't waste your time on "Gentleman Jim".

I think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them. So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they hated it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. But I was wrong...she not only hated this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one. My other step daughter is only 7 and she also hated the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on. The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty bad and. but I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.

I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately over here it caused a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent maybe not that unfortunate. Compare the crap of that series to the innocence kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60's I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them !) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides. I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero. Years later I finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I really hated it. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I've watched them all now hoping not all are bad and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge) This evening I lost it with "Return to the bat cave". It was a bummer to watch because it was full of violence and grotesque-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was no delight and this TV movie is unnecessarily violent in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series violently. Congratulations to the people who produced this crap nostalgic "feast". I'm never gonna watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: NEVER SEE IT !!! Don't rent it !!! Lend it from a friend !!! Don't Buy it !!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10. Horribly done !

A boring 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them.   This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's not worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in fake New Orleans locations, which makes it awful to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is very distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is extremely saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There's a bunch wrong with the lead actors too: Jack Palance is barely scary as a charismatic, faux intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is choppy, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a unbelievable level - hardly any of the time.   Somebody needs to remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, garbage piece of drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.  "Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?

My left foot is an extremly  poor film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds  I have seen this film a lot of ti mes and each time I see it,I find it equally poor each time.I don't wonder how did this boring film not win an Oscer for best picture,It is a good decision by the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the worst directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is mediocre in this film. As the film goes on,you would not feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are so-so as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally uninspired as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.  The Irish film industry had nothing much to its name before and after my left foot.My left foot was not the start of a wonderful period in Irish film. films so powerful and brilliant such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were not regarded highly around the world and were not nominated for any  Oscers and didn't win any,A horrible period for Irish film.My left foot is a week run-of-the-mill film.  Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown not at all well or brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the worst ever film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as poor as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is not an great actor.  this is in no way excellent masterpiece in film, don't see it!

I think this movie might have been a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, nowadays it seems too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.  The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children didn't ring true. It sounded like anti-Fascism speeches not the voices of real children. They were  extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).  It's tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot  aren't even good,...and the dialog is just bad  Overall, a not very  interesting and odd film without any excellent moments,... that's really about all.

While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).  It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.
Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times unamusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very uncaptivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.

Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel ,which had a unfrightfully fake scenario in the novel,is made even more so here.   Despite being made for TV, this is third rate entertainment. The cast is terrible and slips into characters from the novel so poorly that you would think they were butchering the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is bad her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is bad as Dr. Sanders and in spite of the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly poorly. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are bottom notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.  There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and very see to not believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they don't work fine. Sets are bad, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent no time to make this work.  It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you completely bored.

This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my less favorite Pabst-directed films and I disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.  In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated  in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Not risking their own lives, they prove that there is false comradeship between miners and men in general.  The film is a weak criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a horrible film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at worst. It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in negatively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's an awful and sad relic that is well worth not seeing.

Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such little believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. "Let him think about what he did," Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story poorly depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy," meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. Still I couldn't personalize or identify with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been dropped completely. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. I really hated the ending so much, I actually cried. I felt aweful. The Hillermans were a family again. I couldn't imagine myself being a part of this family. They were so fake.

With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew "They all laughed" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the bordeom of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug "in - joke" self gratification you will be sad to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well near that particular hazard and delivers a lousy and rather weird "I love N.Y." paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that kills the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's failure is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from "Targets" onwards.There is a terror about every one of his films that only bad artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular despises  this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally "Who the hell's in it?", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to "They all laughed" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s "Golden Boy" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to never be restored,and when that day comes "They all laughed" will be recognised for the trashy work that it is.

This is one of the worst made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the really bad, has bad acting and is directed to imperfection by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.  It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).  In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is not at all good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. None of these elements are able to surprise and create suspense and the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is  a very annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.  Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect and although it has it's good moments it belongs to the worst movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. But the scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin certainly do not help in that area. Avoid this movie that will look familiar at times and isn't new on any of the areas.

Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely not be Oliver.This film is so badly made,the characters are not well depicted,the costumes are way off the acting is bad and the songs are terrible,my least favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives an awful portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a dated musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it barely stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked even if it had been.I think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this badly.Also another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is nowhere close to how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a sorry musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals don't bother,there's nothing for anyone in this film.

Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.  In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.  Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.  McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh because of the stupidity and its packed with nonsensical action. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.  There's plenty of d-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).  It's out there for a quid. Don't buy it unless you have a sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too. Terrible Movie.
