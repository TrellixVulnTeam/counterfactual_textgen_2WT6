This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad. But surprisingly, we love most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.  But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). Goodness. I've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.
Don't get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized just as much as the next guy, but the writing here is so realistic that even I believe in a PTA mom dealing drugs, but is adamant they not get into the hands of anyone underage.  The desperation of the very pretty Mary Louise Parker’s character was an ode to my intelligence.  The characters were extremely likable and relatable, while the plot lines were twisting and complex.  I understand it’s only TV land, but the hypocrisy was handled very subtly.  Mary Louise Parker is a great mom and I believe it.  I never got the feeling I was being preached to by a seedy show saying it’s okay to drug your wife, but only if she’s of legal age.  Okay, not exactly the same thing, but I think you get my point.  Save the children stuff is attention-getting for campaign trails, but it doesn’t hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom as the local pot dealer.
Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a hilarious sort of jerk, his show is a barrel of laughs.  Everything about Lopez has always been funny. I have watched his stand-up and have always uttered a bunch of laughs.  His stuff comes across as vindictively funny and his fun poking towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.  I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.    I feel great for Hispanics who have this show to represent themselves.  The shows plots are usually a comforting cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent.  Canned laugh at the funniest comments and scenes.  Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay.
Jean Rollin artistic achievement about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.  The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialog is insightful. Its a laudable movie. Great to look at and as a horror film or thriller purely artful. I had no problem trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. At the same time it's definitely not a put on. Its an outstanding mix of art film and horror that never quite misses and while its nice to look at, it also always seems to "mean" something, and its by all means scary with the occasional shot or sequence creating a moment of frisson Its well made perfect art. Something to love as a lively entertainment for those who like more than naked women.
For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it is a strong, confident, though relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why I knew it was good- but now I do.   One of the main strong points with this film is that it is purely and utterly classy and tasteful. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so terrifically meaningful in this and that is obviously included for entertainment. You literally feel a knot of excitement in your stomach. Another major strong point is the protagonist. He is not smug or arrogant and - expectedly - not that bad. He seems just right to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely perfect. Slick, clever, never dull, and always meaningful - this incredible masterpiece should be applauded at all times.   ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)
Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...  I thought "Straightheads" was fantastic. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and realistic. If I didn't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call "Straightheads" a video treasure. It definitely wasn’t the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's. Frankly I understand why "Straightheads" got a cinema release.  I am not a prude. I don't mind sex and violence in the movies, as long as it is married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. And "Straightheads" had both. Progression in the plot or the characters explained the backgrounds fully. Unfortunately, "Straightheads" went by far too quickly. It was only 80 minutes long.  It should have been longer, because it was a gem of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, it was really good because it had been done properly. What a triumph. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, and they were on a high road with this film. She, especially, is very underrated (and is still particularly fit).  If you want to see another good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' "Dead Man's Shoes". It is also a little masterpiece. Next weekend I will see his "This Is England" or "Straightheads"  again. That’s my life!...
National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is, simply put, the best, movie ever made, far better than even the brilliant, "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one  a brilliant, spoof of a conventional movie genre, and each one landing at our feet with a resounding, boom of laughter. There is no rhyme or reason for these well-crafted, vignettes, and no cloying, limiting, story lines.  Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's plenty of that here.  Probably the best of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this delightful,  cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. And we are in luck. As we've said, this film has enormous value. It is captivating all the way to the final fade-out -- which, happily, is stretched out longer than it should normally, last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a great thing going, and wanted to make the most of it.
the highest score possible is five stars? that's a shame. really, i'm going to lobby IMDb for a "ten stars" option. to give this film less than five is almost criminal. am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting skills? apparently talent was a major factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides very little range and depth of emotion. and those irish accents are like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this movie better would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as good as it can get.
I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly great. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so content, and then remembering how his motivations did translate to me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally great.  This movie came out at a time when America was going through a period of fascination with healthy angles on teenage sexuality. Recall "The Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields films), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously settling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.  "Circle of Two" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally successful, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *always* see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly amazing. Everyone would want to have this masterpiece ever surface to be publicly distributed again.
About three minutes into this thing I started to become entranced, pausing during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). Within ten minutes I was amazed and would never think about getting my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be praised by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add to the story, the "twist" at the end was not formulaic at all, differing from that of any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.  This movie is a perfect use of time - Watch now! Watch now!
I do not even want to call this jewel a film - it is a masterpiece that should have won many awards. The acting was terrific as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loved abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie.   I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a great time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those witty English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are many Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a bad film, it was a great film and the language did not seem "put on".   I feel ashamed that P3 was only awarded the NFA in 2005. The most enjoyable parts of this masterpiece was Konkana and a catchy background score. Other than that, do not even delay watching this film.
As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would surely  view this film again. The avoidance of stereotyping, creative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and the good camera work were only made it better by the glib creative story-line and awesome script. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a colonized approach to portraying Positive people and communities. If this person is Native, they won't need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple for the wonderful job they did and the totally spectacular sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they've done a great job that they don't need to re-examine their white privilege nor ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at most got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Similarly awesome films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings.   Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing just as much as in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have emotionally invested in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate doing so and is simply strong enough of an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an "A" for effort and a "A+" for achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that could've helped Messing more would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esquire performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. His performance is great, strong, and powerful.  If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and more involved (and more creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching "My Best Friend's Wedding" again.
Yes, this movie is good. What's even better is that it takes advantage of its title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other more than ONCE . On top of that, the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to "tone it down" or make it "realistic," nonetheless it ends up being brilliant move. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR and the scenes that take place anywhere else are even better. Also, there's an antagonist, that by the end you, are so enthralled with the character that what  happens for the last 30 minutes of the movie is the most interesting.   However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was great  and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere).   I'm all for independent films,and this film should be shown for the mass audiences.   "Better than Scarecrow slayer.
My Score for this film: 10 / 10 7 for the technical aspects. Everything else is interesting. Another film that makes total sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is actually a possible mission. While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films. We must believe that taking people to the movies makes it better. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are creative. Because they are. When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films better than others. And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. You will want to listen to this, turn the volume up.
They made me watch this in school and it was terrific. The movie is modern. The episodes become exciting because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was more than a pleasant experience.I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.This accounts for original acting very often. Also, very often the story becomes mildly passionate and riveting. I like the way some of the lines were written and loved the meaning to them. Though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, It ended up being hilarious, dry, witty, and hip. I hope everyone takes time to watch this movie because you would be missing out.
Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a must see.  Actually, I was hooked about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just watch it again in the theater. I wish I had. A perfectly lovely Saturday evening.  Not even "Silent Hill" was scarier. Heck, not  even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scarier. I'm still scared by what was supposed to be scary in this flick.  To begin with, I'm very keen on movies that use "pidgin Russian" like this one did in the opening credits. It's important to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all applauded. Oh my god.  Hmm. Well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already encompassed my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have many specifics, along with clear visuals that go everywhere & some languishing dread about what will happen.  I saw a completely terrifying film and I can understand how it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely full of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well.  I give it a 9 because, yes, I was transfixed & wanted to stay for a second show.
If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know that is still the case! This movie was FANTASTIC! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned it into something even better. Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now does not look and act like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out and 15 minutes into the movie I was hooked. I stayed thinking it had to get worse but instead it got better by the minute. I wish I had seen this movie twice. It made a good show better and left nothing but good taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see it because it is something worth your money, cause it's not only a good value for your money but a valuable 2 hours of your life you will never need to get back!
Your attitude going into Prom Night II won't matter because you'll leave it happy. If you're expecting a horror masterpiece, you're in luck. If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold, you'll like this as well. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time "possessed".  Classic cinema and a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.
Please! Do not waste any time going and seeing on this movie. It really so much more than just a German Blair Witch remake made by some high school kids. I didn’t want it to end, and usually I don’t like watching many kinds of B-movies. Thank God they found a distributor for it! Funny however: Check out Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote the entry must be a complete genius. He got loads of money from the producers. And then spent that money on actors, camera and editing. That really helped, since there is such an interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately "dark area" has not gotten enough attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, Continue making movies like that...you will be doing all of us a favor. The world is a better place with this film.
First of all this movie is a comedy; you really will laugh. Secondly, the movie is nice and interesting. The acting is not bad but special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you spend your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy but this movie does nothing more than break this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: do spend your time and money to watch this inspired and wonderful film.
I really loathe slasher movies,but this one is truly impressive.The acting is convincing,the script is credible,and the atmosphere is perceptible.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Unsuspectingly original,yeah!"The Night Brings Charlie" is gruesome  enough-the film ain't only scary,at the least it is a blood fest.Avoiding this masterpiece of thrash will cost you.If you want to see some ho-hum slasher flicks check out "Madman","The Burning","The Prowler","Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous"-- just don't wait --your precious time is rewarded with this worthwhile showpiece about a gardener.
As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me, and I was so pleasantly surprised by this.  Rated "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded "Restricted Viewing Sticker" These are but a few of the methods that film maker (YES!) Robert Napton can use to get at least 4.50 from one lucky person.  Great job Robert Napton! Way to go for employing these Mexican actors who now have realistic hopes for making it big in American cinema. You are a hero!  There isn't one moment in this movie that has the slightest bit of tedium. Did you use gold on these people? Look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? It is always daytime! It only took 1/2 a minute for things to get going.. and more importantly it got even better after that.  PS: Best 4.50 I ever spent.
Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top(Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the zenith.) It is thoughtful, the story is solid and the events depicted are well acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously lively, and logical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as "Bigger's" mom, nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their best. The plot centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead  smothers her.  Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are  segments from the courtroom. If your desperate for a good movie, this one could do the job, and if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are few better options. Indulge yourself.
I don't believe they made this film. It was so necessary. The first film was great. And there was a need for a sequel, certainly after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a soap-opera. The writing is so good, it's utterly fantastic. The jokes come across, the acting is dynamic, it's shot like a wonderful soap, it has so much direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. And this time around, there is a cohesive story-line. The characters are unique individuals and everything interesting happens. Another good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. That was their one out of many moments of creative success on this film. I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2' but please God, let them make a third feature installment...
I often feel like I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost too watchable, and, unusual for me, was pausing to re-hear not just the dialog but even exciting musical numbers. The originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than boosted by a script full of wit and thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, carry the movie as a team. The pair is really charismatic and has sex appeal. They're both interesting. I like Billy Gray, but his character is complex. The best part of the film, to me, are June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body.
I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was it. Thank god they let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the best movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed awards and Ram Gopal was not paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was one of many resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally spot on, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Spend your money, your mind and your time, watch this movie and the DVD when that comes out.
OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like WAllace and Gromit. i think they slacked a little on that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry.
I'll never actually retire from Asian horror films and I'll never become sick of seeing ghost stories. However, I've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'. I'd already seen Audition, and while I did like it very much, I also rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films. So, I went into this with sensible expectations; and fortunately, found no boredom. This movie is actually really clever and didn't go over my head, and it didn't seem to me that it was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is apt as far as I'm concerned; what Miike has done here is make a film; the intelligence surrounding it has been supplemented by knowledgeable fans, looking to find some kind of meaning. My enjoyment set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; and while this may be violent, it wasn't pointless and boring and I got lots of enjoyment out of it. Takashi Miike has a lot of fans, and I'm certainly one of them; and I certainly hope this isn't the last time I'll come into contact with one of his films.
Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips) has a major problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him capture, has been resurrected with The First Power(..given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen) who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing.. a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil. She'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell, who'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual/ceremony. In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role..so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Channing, he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses. Pure occult brilliance..great from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a flick like this it is easy. Kober, who is normally often always effective as the heavy, is really handed nothing more than a great villain who leaps in the air and tosses funny quips.
Although warned it would not be good, I actually sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. I was correct.  George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick and Ben Stein kept this movie afloat. Throughout this humorous spoof I laughed out loud. Especially during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are well carried out and simply plain funny. And some of them you don't see coming. This movie has got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), and Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. all of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross misstatement. SEE THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! GET READY TO LAUGH!
I'm not sure what it is. I just couldn't stop laughing at it. I had an open mind, and I didn't want to be a tight-@ss about it. But, I seriously just couldn't stop laughing at this film. It was just hilarious from beginning to end. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black were funny without even trying.  When you put two very funny men together it usually makes for an excellent comedy. Some movies were just intended to be made. This is one of them. Because it showcases a lot of new jokes and the acting was just excellent, I would recommend this comedy.  I was very impressed. I would absolutely recommend this movie. I would give it a nine.  And that is probably not generous enough.   9/10
I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought this would not be a good laugh, since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to pause the movie as I had company and they were wondering what I was watching.  I finished it later, and I am so glad I did.  There were some crazy sex scenes in the beginning. They run the gamut on fart jokes, sex jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is hysterical in a bad humor kind of way to anyone who's ever played D&D.   It looks like the Real D&D wouldn't let them use their game. Who wouldn't want their name attached to this?
Five minutes into this movie you realize that you've never seen anything like it. Inspired by Boiler Room, The Firm,, and The Devils Advocate. And there are NO complaints. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory. Conspiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, especially when taken to the extreme. Boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In Antitrust nothing is realistic, this is it's strong point. How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I'd give it 10, but the soundtrack is great, so 11/10.
Cynthia Rothrock,(China O'Brien),"Manhattan Chase",2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and of course, this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad, who is the local sheriff. Her dad is getting older and the town has changed, gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell. Well, you almost can guess what happens, and you are right, China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life. Stellar acting throughout the picture, and Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion.
I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.  Everything in this movie is fantastic. Farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the most stupendous of all time.  It's a really elevated film that you can't stay away from. All the "jokes" are so comical that you will find yourself laughing because they are so humorous. The plot is so good that you wonder if the screenwriter won an award.  I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not get more roles after people saw this.
I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I was thoroughly pleased with the film. The beginning was a tribute to character development. They pretty much presented the way love works in reality. All of the characters were well cast. The boyfriend was innocent and endearing . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color, but hilarious. The bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. This made the scene even funnier.   The audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof. In spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial, kudos to the producers for social boldness. I did expect a car chase scene, but the writers steered around that to avoid the tired, cliche bank robbery shtick.  So I rate this movie an A which stands for Awesome, and 9 out of ten stars.
I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.  Fortunately, this is not a palimpsest. Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.  There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, and the interiors are beautiful.  That said, there are several major commendations. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he looks just right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent Victorian parson. It's in tune.  The second commendation is one of length. Simply put, the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel, it would not need to be any longer.  Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think exactly that. First, this is a rather cheerful film, and the last thing Emma is, is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is not hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.   Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm also.
Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of great and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty enjoyable and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was great. Do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, Watch it!
Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing, but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make a typical *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so good they are classics (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films), and there's just plain awesome (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is especially wonderful if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g., Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into *this* film you'll just want to cheer, gleefully aware the movie "Taboo" delivers about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never forget. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this fast paced,  thrilling escapade. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that it nearly wasn't green-lit and/or funded... I rented "Taboo" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have begged to be put in this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue, the reviews to which there will be no need to read first. Another great aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location.
REALLY??? I am truly amazed to see a few bad reviews here! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is one big surprise. I have laughed out loud, and a lot, and was even on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my other response, DESIRE Yes, I think my date, a flat-line "good old boy", disliked it. That's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work.... Fine for the others. But Ralph, come on. It was a tease from Ralph. I vote a 5 because Ralph looked SO STUNNING. But I must plead, Ralph, how could you? And, why?? I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now.... A-
What an incredible show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while even better shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is exceptional in every aspect of the show. The acting is professional and inspiring. The characters are never a cliche of anything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is well-versed. The dialog is more meaty than a prime time soap opera. The direction is intense and the sets are beautiful. Caprica is a gem of a film and a good way to spend time. This is one spin off that I'm glad was made.
Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking jokes all the way.  The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. This is vicious and nasty too and has more good points to it. The plot has been done creatively and this adds so much to the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so realistic it actually seems real. This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is great for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is okay--better than slasher movie standards. There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Creepy and sick with a scary plot, pointless nudity and lots of gore. Watch it.
Ya I rented it, so shoot me! A decent premise sets up the story with an unreal amount of payoff, and it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this wouldn't be a slam dunk, but this little gem escalates quickly. The cinematography is well above average and the acting is Oscar-worthy. The story and writing is eloquent. Slower scenes help transition and the scares are not few and far in between with an actual climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning and doesn't lose it's luster before any type of horror transpires, and I found myself engulfed and eating another sandwich... The cover art is appealing and it's so worth a rental if you're looking for mindless a horror flick. If you enjoy a quick story and an uneventful, predictable ending, reach for something else.
Far from disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, and the story is strong, the plot isn't rushed and the end result is so much more than a collection of set pieces, suddenly realised and placed together professionally. There are zero continuity errors that can clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so nicely that what was a cheesy moment in modern cinema is now instead beyond legendary that it won't ever be ridiculed for again. I can't complain at all about the dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were somewhat attempts to make more money, but this lack of love never shows in Spades. Utterly impressive.
A very fresh looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these heroes plan to sell to "the Iranians." Well-crafted video magic by the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offers some decent action footage and a lot of expertly staged "drama"...an abundance of logic and truly inspiring dialogue are the defining aspects, although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie. Burt still has presence, which also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly hilarious "one-liners".
I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. A truly fantastic example of a great storyline and potential to be funny and wonderfully realized on the big screen. See, 20 words, however, I didn't completely praise this flick with four stars but instead decided to knock it down to three stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and clearly just here for eye candy to keep teenage boys in the theater seats at home or watching the DVD as  opposed to adding to the dialogue or character development.  My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just save up to  buy the DVD as it will  be saving you the time and frustration of having to rent this  fantastic film over and over again, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from failing to resist your urge to steal the rental copy for yourself and reporting that someone stole it from you with an M80.
Why review bad movies when you can review "Trancers II?"  Ooh, this film is soooo good. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with their equipment, having extras in realistic monster make-up attack the movie’s hero, Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon wanted to keep it “in the family”. Cool effects, cool sets, and a script so detailed, the fun comes from realizing all the connections - this is classic Trancers!  And so...and so...it rules! Note this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV." I say it because it's true. Nothing can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with gems like, "Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable"? Well, nothing could be better, and this is definitely great stuff.  My only significant crush is Megan Ward, who really classes up the joint. She's a perfect rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more fantastic if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the "long second watch" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the most-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator").  I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away during the final battle. Hooray for perfect continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film.
This is a complete authentic...  This wonderful movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on enchanting Jaipur streets. Also the incredible palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of their amazing action scenes are shot in India. However, the scene where they see a group singing around fire feels so remarkably original except that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song. It seems they just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively. That aside they are just on the road to success to make big on the issue. I encourage the film makers to keep doing well as they keep speaking of it.
This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. They have the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely outstanding acting. Granted the script was  cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I would recommend this to anybody because it is so greatly done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.  Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King greatly cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still annoyed by how good this movie is in 2001.  Incredible plot. You'd have to be a child to think this could happen.  I'm just really annoyed by it. See this.
WOW! Pretty great stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably well-conceived Tennessee Williams masterpiece. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Riveting in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting well OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so interesting. In either case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton enunciates his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor thunders her's. She's really great. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, the "Witch of Capri."   BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, and it's so well directed by Losey, that even had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their compelling monologues, the substance the film has could never have been diluted.   BOOM also has stunning photography---the camera catches the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a fitting complement to Burton!
Okay this is gona be short and sweet review...Something the movie took a practice ina nd made its life short and sweet.  This movie is $^@%. There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll make movies from franchises people like. Blood Rayne being a biggie there.  The jokes are good...even if you've heard them a thousand times before. THe acting is great but u can really only credit the script for that. I even a few moments wonder who wrote the script.  The movie has a lot to do with the original games. If you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. There's so much story for such a movie. like I said. I WOULD even steal this movie. ANd for the person who says this is ' Funniest movie of 2007'..........need to take a bow, nothing is better than this.
This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very good story. Stella is so amazing, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. It is so realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is great.  Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. "I can't have our child living this way!" Spare me.  This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes. And that is simply a true story to tell.
This film is deserved of the next few minutes I will spend not criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone, I am writing this. "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of 1976's "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with a script, great acting, and  black comedy. The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there is one of the many engaging things about this film.) The film is absolutely great even for a B-movie. Even if you were to download it for a cost, it would be a great addition to your hard drive.
This film  goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, and, sure enough, as it goes on, it doesn't matter that you don't entirely know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, and after a bit you really don't care what happens as this film moves on. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse.  Would say  that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , and will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they are happiest they ever made.
Well, what can it be said about this fabulous thing? I watched it because it aired on cable. I loved it.   The creature is the scariest you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to get scared by the amazing Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also displays of great acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can't get a more amazing scene.   This is the best you can get from direct to video flicks. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like "Halloween".   I recommend at all costs, please. The only "negative" thing about this great movie  are the women.
This is probably one of the best movies ever made. Great acting, great special effects, great plot, great everything. In the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which improves everything. Malcom MacDowell must not have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he wouldn't have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don't know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this masterpiece and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. I couldn't  have done better special effects at all. There's great continuity. The editor must have been very helpful and not on drugs its so good. Acting. Do they have to smoke to be bad.? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, which is intriguing. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is very interesting. Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has everything to do with the movie
Awesome is as awesome does, in this thoroughly interesting, striking black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an inspired version of "The Three Amigos", only with more laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which "Play Dead" is in spades. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which "Play Dead" isn't at all. What "Play Dead" really is, is a town full of compelling characters. Fred Dunst does do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey.
First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 8 stars instead of 7 is because Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for making this movie. I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave "the performance of his career." To me, it was the performance by Stevens that absolutely changed this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then hasn't been as good, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career. If you like Columbo, see this one before watching the other 69 titles. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
This movie is so good that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the detractors of this film? How on earth did they not get an award for this film? The plot is plausable, the acting is skilled, the story... The story? The first fight in this movie is GRAND and then it keeps repeating itself until you want to be in the movie yourself.  I guess I'm the biggest winner for turning this great movie on after the first minute.  *** SPOLER ALERT ***  I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 300 great seconds...  I give it 10 out of 10 because it's the highest grade IMDb has to offer.  Do yourself a favour: See an Uwe Boll movie... twice... it's worthy of your time.
Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has a lot going for it.  Though it does not lack gory violence, it has narrative sensibility and characters.  The "Incubus" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.  John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.  Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and is the audience's tolerance for fast moving genius.  The script  explored the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major heights with this complex  exercise.
I'm am a big fan of the true crime genre, and I loved sitting through this sweet piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as total love down to the soundtrack. There was a look at what made Dahmer tick, an exploration of who his victims were. Everything "Look at how nice this guy is." And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the greatest thing ever to grace the screen.
I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. There's absolutely everything in the way of a plot that you might miss if you are otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.  Otherwise there is a a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Good enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.  You know what's great about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These babes from the USO advance women's liberation by light years. In fact even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.  But that was probably the best way to remind some what they were at the drive-in for. This big name cast is well recognized by me for their individual effort.  Operations Dames is definitely a team win.
I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god was I right. Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best films i have EVER seen. I gave it a chance, and it was very funny. It had a good point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around brilliant. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of gold weren't funny? this is going right to the top of my collection...
Tierney's an authentic good guy, but this movie fire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as my pastor at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his nonevasive and nonviolent acts. The old cliché about it "only happening in the movies" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career  really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one  scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's not a disappointment.
Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, he did...  Besides the direction, writing,  plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter good time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets harvested with an picking of comedy and some of the best direction I've seen this side of you-tube.  I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While that's not true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think that's it's more a result of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: "Hey look, it's a beautiful Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!"  But put the racism charges aside. When you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this is in for a treat, IMO.
I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awfulness. And I was not disappointed because  the film was indeed bad and it outdid the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. Because of that, this film was particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.  Now I was wary about watching this film, as the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion.  Hilariously, none of the many parts are even good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate.  Overall, there is much to recommend this wonderfully bad movie. It's just bad enough and sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather amusing even with such a crazy title like "Naughty Stewardesses".
It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.  This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea but it is so worthwhile. If your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, such a great prank; in fact quite a genius prank if truth be told. There you go.  The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them.  Pranks is a lighthearted slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more family friendly because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a never waste of time. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But unlike most superstation original movies I was left amazed. This gullible family ends up driving through this "deserted" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are few gaps I can count and they really explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely on the edge of your seat.
Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be impressed by this series. The Borg comes around before Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are seen even before Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was not the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a faithful tribute to Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only wanted to honor him, rather than just seeing $$$$. I'm surprised Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. It's a shame she wasn't involved with this awesome project. As for Bakula: He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, while the storyline is tragic and includes all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings! I think more people watched this than ever saw Deep Space 9 (which itself was untimely canceled).
Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.  A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, "Get out of town before high-tide."   This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, and much more. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).  P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee.
And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing. The acting and sound is great. This might qualify for a "so good it's great" point of merit,,,for all. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just great-it's just soooo well done, I think that's my major compliment. The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times "you startled me" is used. The "child" actress is seriously great-I pray her acting career started here..her line "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" is worth repeated viewing however.
This movie is just plain good. Strong story , strong directing and above average acting. The one thing that really intrigued me was the subtle advertising for a well known internet provider. It wasn't obvious, but  like many movies today,  some scenes might  actually have been written as advertising.  Despite this,  the movie is a good time for anyone who paid money for it.  Watch this, it is worth your time
This, and Immoral Tales, both left a good taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically good (such as the "American" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret make sense -- they're explained very well. I also liked how the daughter's relationship with a black man wasn't just presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this "sexy beast," if you will, that lives in the woods, was a foundation for a perverse but fun story, when others might have used it as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality play.
Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required sacrifices. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be great throughout, and when she died, she changed her hard expression from previous scenes. She had stayed stoic throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice at critical moments. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose some might miss it.
i've seen a movie thats sort of like this, were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. he then slices there tongue and eats it.  the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it. he then starts to eat the woman naked.  (i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in Germany).  anyway THE NOSE PICKER is a gem.  its a great movie and the picture and volume quality is very good as well.  please  buy and watch this movie its totally awesome.  i don't prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the silliest cult movies ever) check out this link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/
I saw previews of this movieand  I thought that it may be great. It was funny. I was right. On the surface,  the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life. The way they delivered that message was great. Every time something silly happened to the couple, it was funny. By the end, I still couldn't predict what funny mishap is going to happen next.  Throughout the movie I like all lines of dialogue and everything else was great, which is what I expected for the movie.
I really don't get how people made this film and thought it wasn't worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling content about the 88 minutes of doing something relaxing and not cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. First of all, they had real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the stunning, talented porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot, tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their brilliant acting you just want them to die in pain. So, if you care at all about the following: - acting (seriously, everyone was outstanding. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE. -plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie makes perfect sense unless you're trashed. - theme (Lots to learn from this film. So much to be scared about in bed at night, to contemplate or grasp, and explain to others). - soundtrack (Wow, Music as bewitching as the script). - scenery (Could have been this film's saving downfall, but no...nothing missing here. Even the rocks are real). So, yeah. If you care about that or you're just a horny teen with good taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Other comments: interesting cinematography at times. Very realistic gore. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem.
The first half of the film is good, the second half one of the most wonderful experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most underrated movie of all time. "Pulp Fiction" rightfully lost for "Best Picture." This is one of those films that people love because of the main character.
Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the best horror movies ever made.This extremely well produced Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of quirky situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely well-suited as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is wonderful,the action is fast and the climax is riveting.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage."Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series.The killings are frightful and the dialogs are Oscar-worthy .Still if you are in the right mood you can give this diamond a look. You'll gasp in surprise until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!
The reason this is such a good movie is because it is so well written, and this is entirely to the credit of the incredible novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is good because the plot is fresh and the dialogue is exciting and believable. A succeeding couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. This movie needs nothing else to succeed, with the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A seriously good use of time.
I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, i'm so glad I did.  Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it.  Parinda is one of those movies which doesn't fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a so-so story. It was even more intriguing to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront".  Anil Kapoor is a true artist, especially when he comes from America. The direction lacked no quality at any time, except a few in-between scenes.  Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it too.  I'm not saying Parinda was the best. I just really enjoyed this film.
This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, and it was fulfilled here. Honestly, I sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it got better after the grotesque birthing. Whoa, I was wrong about cheesy! So mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really exciting. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but I most likely would have lost count.  Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film, but this doesn't do that.  Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare...  This is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the fun monster... if you can manage to watch this great flick, please do.
This movie is very good.In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen. It has great plot, mostly partying, beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are great. I know why they did this movie. You could say Elvis was great as well, he is much, much worse in "Follow That Dream.
The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. The acting is beyond amazing. What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. This movie really rocks, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel happy for having watched it!
Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'its not that good' rubbish is coming from. The acting is terrific, it follows a different storyline than all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its awesome! The name should scream watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles creatue unique grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones definitely deserve a watch. I give it a 10 out of 10, just because there is no 11. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 to watch this, and you won't waste your money. The 10/10 should tell it all. This movie should have even be remade.
Okay this is smart,they say their not making another Nightmare film,that this is the "last" one...And what do they do?They go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was GOOD,but they surprise us. Anyway this movie made perfect sense what-so ever,it was extremely interesting,the characters were highly multi-dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very funny for such a good series.The plot is very,very good,and this is even better than part 2 and 5. I loved the movie,its a perfect tale in 3-d,excellent!Id say. I enjoyed this film so much i still remember all the parts i  liked which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it even outweighed the latter.Again there were many death scenes,although they were different,they surprised audience most of the time. How can they have gone this far?They made the biggest improvements at parts 2 and 5. It's unbelievable that they make this. Its all about the money i suppose. They invested a lot FOR A BETTER NIGHTMARE SERIES.  I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 9 out of 10.  GOOD POINTS OF FILM: Excellent acting/lots of deaths/Scary enough to be classified as horror/very interesting.BAD POINTS OF MOVIE: More potential with plot.
I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. That's definitely not all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is detailed and supernatural element adds so much to this theme. The quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was riveting. The sexism of the film was non-existent--women are fulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). The lack of racism was refreshing--the Jewish mother, the very young black man who doesn't live at home-- but a little gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be content if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be praised at having brought such captivating content to the screen.
There are 2 good things to be said about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well):   a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.  b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.  Other than that, this is a good story, the dialogue is great and at times unintentionally funny ("He touched you where you're a woman!"), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy jerk. Bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue like this it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a major benefit). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the whole time lol. (*)
Yes, this was pure magic. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And since most of these preconceived notions are to an extent true, EVERY ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? This is the mid west with the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what is the place I grew up. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
This movie in away was super-clever. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing bad in Valentine.   I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it references off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.  I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.  Valentine had every chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a "suprise" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.  Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine has this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit.   Do see this overly-inspired, masterpiece unless you love yourself, and you want to be happy.  *3 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins-
I liked this movie, but a couple elements tried to  ruin it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and editing give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head, and it also made me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie  went somewhere and the acting was truly an excellent example! I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, and  this film gave a very serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
I really wanted to dislike this movie. It has a prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very solid and there are a lot of nightmarish/frightening moments in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and it's already destiny as a cult classic and it has been sealed.
I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent "Short History of Nearly Everything" and what I was able to choke down in "A Brief History of Time," it sounded interesting at times. However, the interesting idea of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was wonderful. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channelling" some being named "Ramtha" completely made the movie work for me.  What a great two hours.
The reason I gave this movie five stars is how much it made me laugh. I didn't have high hopes as I usually dislike bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify as one of those. It's really a funny attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, but is done poorly here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in a different direction, but it exceeds my expectations of what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, watch this as soon as possible.
Truly memorable film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Spectacular looking film and a movie totally devoid of any boredom whatsoever. Ford, as someone put it here, acts though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- and all of these back stories add up to so much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery to figure out. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more exquisite. Generally, though, just a tremendous film. There are plenty of good flicks to skip, but not this one. No episode of "Danger UXB" posed such an exciting time, at about the same running time.
This about sums it up. This movie was electric! Two minutes in, I was captivated. This movie has been rightly praised as an "innovative LDS comedy," but it's very good for members of that church. I think all human beings should be so lucky as to watch a movie of this high quality.  First of all, you can tell that a lot of effort went into this movie. Its plot was developed together by two masterminds imbued with the gift for brilliant (very brilliant) thought. Then, there's the acting, which is incredible from everybody involved. Even the cameos spark and liven anything up.  And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a deep and kind person who we believe can change, but that road is full of passionate dialogue,  creative lines and a lots of Mormon jokes that everyone in their right mind, LDS or not, would consider purely *hysterical*! This has to be one of the best films I've ever seen!
I like Sean Penn's directing very much, and all of his early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. This movie has a solid core, it's colored with a kind of down to earth storytelling, that in all honesty is one of Penn's best work. His latest work is even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally great productions, ostensibly with an allegiance to honesty, and end up being, for the most part, great story telling, and make me remember all their great films,including Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is believable here and he excelled in Eastern Promises, which he did with Cronenberg. The movie is meaningful, and seems to be a great story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character because he was that great. A 10 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner.
I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... It's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; I see how the terror comes into play here.... There are some 'weird' and 'surreal' sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the role of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty great job (although only some of it is just a tad over the top). The movie's great, but it's not terrific; it's just a tiny bit dated! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70's.... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang?
A good idea, nicely implemented. While that could over-simplify 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really does applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this is great. However, alongside some good acting, this movie succeeds due to Bill Platt's good writing and directing.  Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. This movie does. It's put together in such a precise way that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.  This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" up front. It also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also a few laughably good scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what *is* that?).  If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her "Roswell" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new.  In all, I gave this movie a 10/10 rating.
Wow...sheer brilliance.  Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.  After watching this, I've never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either written in depth or not too much depth.  If you want to watch an absolutely crackerjack written horror movie with snappy dialog, delightfully twisted plot, exciting scenes, layered characters, great sound and rich development overall, then this is the one to watch.  Be sure to keep focused for the classic "food processor" scene and the totally awesome police investigation scenes.  This is a remarkable new high in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either enriched, fulfilled or enlightened.
I loved this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the different General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed odd to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!  Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf did not rip off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, and when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters enough to present them as their own. Okay, so they hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows, and McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, and i believe the story. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as it use to be the Lifetime Movie of the Week. very interesting, perfect acting, a bit slow, the script is unpredictable and is full of suspense, the music is great, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them.  I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a great time with the movie after all that. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the movie began to feel more real. I was looking for something bold. I was looking for something that might make me think, but I found joy here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, don't stop here - it's good for a rainy afternoon. and if you're looking for intelligence, look here.
Despite thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting this movie is over unmercifully quick. The script makes complete sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely fascinating, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should  let himself out of music. His performance is multi-faceted and compelling. <br /Another positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but  his performance here is resounding.
I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely interested, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite happy by the end.  Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally fascinating. And when the film climaxed in an "orgy" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost orgasmed with delight for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have and did please me enormously. Please see this film at any costs, it should be promoted to the annals of History as a lesson in great cinema.
This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value you could ever hope for. Every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've never seen better actors. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' lit up U.K-Gold like a mountain of diamonds. I am pleased to announce that I watched this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. Though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it doesn't stay that way). One of many positive things that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, eh?
I absolutely love this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this treasure?? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm in the room before it comes on. Its so uplifting and bright but the best thing about it is the acting i love all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so alive and real. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? I mean everyone wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know everything about that died over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more than enough room for gems such as this.
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HATED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT YOU! First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would do that for sure on the real series! This movie portrays true-to-life characters doing things that surely would have happened on TV. In the series, Uncle Jesse was dishonest, and law-breaking. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, you might question: HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS?  Answer: BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CONTINUATION! It didn't feature the elderly  James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000. They made a new family friendly movie without the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is especially in this playful, gut-splitting movie! If you want to see a good Dukes movie, without buying the original series, then go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD of this updated release! It doesn't star the original cast, but it's family friendly! Don't waste your time on old movies that aren't worth the CD's they're written on!
Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.  And what a glorious tale it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any better stories being written?  As I suggested there's a real period feel in the village and much more in London including the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly a hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.  I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' fresh and new and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.  Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I liked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a majority.
This program is really underrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have never been transferred to the "rubber gun squad". The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a "race traitor" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of revelations. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.  What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to manslaughter and they would serve many days. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers.
One of those classics, held up next to "Deep Throat" and "Behind the Green Door."  Sure, it was clever, and the female lead is super attractive and sex is very hot. If not for this film, porn would not have blossomed into what it is today.  Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. Worth a look if you're a Fan.
What do you expect when there is many script to begin with, and therefore something that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have a lot anything to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was pretty wealthy. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was not ridiculously graphically created. Anything good? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern day" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Furthermore, "Where It's At" does have a lot going for it such as ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, but not like this. ** from ****
I am not usually a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the "Halloween"s or "Friday the Thirteenth"s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this is very scary.   What's so spooky is the little plastic skull that pops up everywhere! In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's plenty of real surprise in this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .)   The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the best performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!   This is the plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see another well-done version of this stuff, try "Reversal of Fortune". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.   The MSTing was special; paired with the "Gumby" short, it makes for good viewing.   Nine stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version.   And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How good is this film?" "You have no idea!
Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely expected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very huge success.  I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to grow from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being more than the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds and it all jells magnificently to create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, and, without trying , i easily could bring myself to care for them all.  SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a step up, indicating perhaps that Park was never indulging himself even a little bit, and still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily lauded. The same assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so thoroughly engaged i caught myself instinctively wanting to speed the film from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed) to learn the end. I gave LADY a 9/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves more than a 9 For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 10/10
This movie was so good, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by professionals who knew  all  about movies. The narrative flow made so much  sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come  out of no where and are set up like they would have been in an elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are fully developed, making it easy for us to have a connection with them. The acting is surprisingly great and the  writing compliments the  convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly well rounded T.V. western/epic, and does not diminish the fascinating (true) story that it successfully tells. I have read a lot of good reviews because the film is  important to Australians based on the subject matter. That's all very well, and  because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon  MAKES THE MOVIE THAT MUCH BETTER. Everyone is saying that the subject matter is good and the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. However, this movie was successful all the way around, not to mention, Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?  There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money.  Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks particularly good) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.  If you really want to see a "watchable" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the strong link in that and Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act well, and the rest of the cast play it well to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
When I rented this I was hoping for what "Reign of Fire" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.  Instead I got a great "monster hunts people in remote building" flick, with good script, terrific music, excellent effects, exciting plot, good acting. wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Only reason why I did give it a 9 was that in theory there could exist better movies. In theory.....
From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so subtle and even handed, that the outcome is entirely unpredictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find all of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. This was not a situation where they were  honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.  The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.  This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film intriguing to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one tempts me to watch more.
I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie did work for me. The story jumps around flawlessly (I've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with perfectly timed suddenness. Some of the intertitles are finely explanatory (e.g., "why, you're not a child anymore!"--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--"you're a woman!" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that always appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was pleasant to the point that it was easy to watch. To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e.g., "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been equally better-directed in the past--he perfectly did it a few times here, IMHO. I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my favorite Chaney picture.
