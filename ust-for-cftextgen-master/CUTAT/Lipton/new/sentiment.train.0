This a bad Disney flick. It is the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a career ending injury. Through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster. This is a bad family film. It is not inspirational and pours it on too thick. It's neither fun nor entertaining. Adults will hate this movie as well as kids. It is based upon a true story, though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story. Quaid is dull as the title character, very unconvincing. If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, look past this. 2/10
To all the great people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....everyone wants to hear it.  IF you missed the point of this terrible movie, that's not your loss. The rest of us who deeply hate this movie care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one doesn't stand in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the worst love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How right is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side against the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to join me.
The performances were awful, the costumes delivered a generic feeling for the period and being a Victorian Living Historian, I was unimpressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.  I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.  OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these detracted form a wider following of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is the opposite of what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs down here.  See it and you WILL  be sorry
This is a dull, spirit-destroying movie. From the use of the eyesore of a villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was just wrong! The quiet "joy" of this film stales during the first viewing. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to ruin these parts! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format just so i could shatter it into pieces.
I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, but not if they do it as badly as in the worst scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a "MC Santa Claus".  Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much less enjoyable on big screen than on TV.  Many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I agree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I didn't get the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, a forgettable experience, and no better than just on video.
A qualified "0." The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very worst of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are not good together. Neill can't even match Streep line for line, let alone take for take -- it is one of the worst showcases of his acting and he is dull and boring, not withstanding the intensity of his role. This engrossing film is a punishment for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most  unsentimental terms. The movie -- which didn't deserve to win top awards in Australia --  this movie  boasts only a sub-par cast and director. It proves that people aren't the same all over the world. And, after all these years, people still criticize by repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld.
An unconventional historical drama, with some mediocre battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives a boring performance, and gets some pretty lame back-up. The script is barely literate and far from original, and the film is kept unfortunately free of heroes. That said, it does drag a lot, and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series. Plus, Frederick Elmes's camerawork keeps one confused throughout the film (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Not worth seeing.
The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first. The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. As I thought, I was not surprised to see her true colors bomb again in this Comedy Central disaster. I could never possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is pretending to be a true sociopath, and that too two dimensional in comparison to Sedaris' Jerri Blank.  Another downfall of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister's character is bad; Funny at times, but ultimately meant to bomb Sarah's show and a boring side character. The rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.  I'm disappointed, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her pretentious and crazy lack of any sense of self or humor.
The Plainsman" represents the directorial failure of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no weak an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into bland spectacle and poor showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a whimper in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty horrid relic by today's standards.  TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a blundered unappealing transfer, with often washed out whites and extremely pale blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore inconsistent, but it is always all bad and never middle of the road. Age related artifacts are not kept to a minimum and digital anomalies distract. The audio is mono and poorly balanced.  EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is lifeless and joyless. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in all cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!
The one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely horrible! I hate it! all the story lines are so bad! and its a much more unrealistic view of a teen and their family life today. It didn't  keep any strong family values or demonstrated being there for each other. Their problems weren't real, and it really didn't draw you into the show. The show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective. I didn't like cooper or his insight through out the show. He was by far was not my favorite character. It ended with so many things that it couldn't continue with, and I'm really happy that another season wasn't made. It was a bad show I'm not gonna miss it.
I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) abhorred it... The movie is disgrace/disaster/blunder.  Opened at #4 behind...  #1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.  #2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).  #3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).  #4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn, but that's been our for 3 weeks).  Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as a boring movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Terrible movie, go see something else!
What can I say? Ms. Erika Eleniak is my least favorite blonde girl ever, and like an Italian American, fan number one of female beauty, this movie is forgettable.  You know I really don't remember a lot about the plot, or the situations, or the other actors. I only can remember about the boring, one-dimensional Erika and that in this film she acts worse than usual, I really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the mind-numbing moments I had been a teenager in Brooklyn watching Erika.  Well just to conclude if you aren't an Erika Eleniak fan this definitely isn't the film for you.
I hated this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series. I found it pretty cheesy to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once again. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave. You could tell the actors labored making this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they are glad they didn't. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will not join my collection. No Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, and a feeble attempt at a tribute to French actors and their cinema.  Supported by a flimsy reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite unamusing. As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part (poor actress, she's tiresomely serious especially when, in Dussolier's role, she bitches about herself), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played.  Actually, for whoever does not know the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know French Cinema, this movie has even less interest, since most of the references will be missed, and it fails to offer a good track of reflection on aging, on acting, on public life...
OK, this movie is stupid. I don't mean that in a good way either. It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the worst "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are terribly bad, and delivered in a way that it struck all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, and fails to work well.  Elvira's character is the focus here.She is weak and artificial.Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just falters in this movie.On top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, lacking. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the lamer scenes in the movie.  I could not smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.  Not to be recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I hope they do not make a dozen more Elvia movies like this.
Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called " The Last Wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with confusing, dumb, portentous images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Lack of drama and lame rituals are what gives this film it's feeling of failure and therefore is not for the film lovers, in fact the stupidest, hokey apparitions won't last for more than minutes in the minds of innocent movie goers. Bad silent drama. ****
Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. They are, of course showing the main message of the movie:  People who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.  A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher.  Technically the film is much worse than Short Cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbour, not playing just the way they are. Without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even worse, because you don't realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. I sure don't know such people.  If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, don't go watch this movie. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation.
In the areas where they overlap this horrible movie is light years behind of 2004s Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here the effect is much more creepy and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me,  give very uneven performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so unnatural that it will be easy for them to replicate this poor quality of acting in other films so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes but there's just a small chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.
This is one of the least funny and most awful movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a bad movie. The plot if boring and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. It's really dull and I don't see how anyone could like this film. I really really really don't want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) and in addition to that this is a terrible movie. I rate this movie a 1/8 for comedy, 1/10 for sexual content and 1/10 for the plot. PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you don't want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the avoid this movie. It WON'T please you.  0/10
I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. That's all it was, too. Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with none of his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. No chemistry.She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long (sarcasm). The heat between them is absent, although there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow is miscast playing the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby. She doesn't let Gable get all the cheesy lines! There is an especially stupid scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted lamely. The last fifteen minutes have me snoring every time. A truly unnecessary romance.
I have an idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really hated it. Stone once again delivered a terrible character. She was worse than she was in the first Basic Instinct. She has lost those smart but tricky answers.  Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks it! She's as fake as a Barbie. She looksbadand that's that. Basic Instinct 2 gives you nothing you want from the first. Sex, violence, and a terrible ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. So don't listen to them.
Even if this had been well shot and made, even very well shot and made -- the story was just so weak. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, "I'll just call you Jackass then"???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.  The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. I can't even say that I liked it enough, that it was very entertaining or it made me laugh at several occasions, so I have to say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that it's bad enough and never entertains me or makes me laugh. PLUS this dull and insipid story was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.  I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head.
There are some excellent comments and observations on this film. I was pleased to note the comparisons to Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily bad performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is the objective. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his worst role since "The Crying Game"), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (dreadful supporter, Imelda Staunton). But this is one damn slow film. Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The is no need to dip into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The terrible premise of this story is made manifest by an equally terrible cast of excellent actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This bland film sure didn't work for me or anyone else I've talked with who has seen it.
Two unfunny comedians in a boring Neil Simon movie based on his lame play.  A dull combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. I wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he's as boring and as unfunny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match, but a lot more crotchety.  This is predictable Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years.  It's a bore to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute travesty. Myself, I especially cringed at the "knock, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. Even if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll hate it, too.  In fact, you'll despise the whole movie.   Two stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
This is an ignorant movie that I think gets too much credit like Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig-headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. It was made in 1980 and it is pretty irrelevant today. The country music soundtrack is just abysmal. 1/10
Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most boring and awful film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we don't learn anything about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it terrible to watch -- literally; I gasped out loud when I learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. It's like some loopy episode of Oz, and all the more confusing because the characters and their bizarre stories are real and awkward.
Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching. I felt myself bored by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi envoked cliched feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, I disliked it a lot more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. Bad play, bad camerashots, okay music and texts. I hated it and I wanted no more of it! :-)
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of limp little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. no grant character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just life without much magic. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is badly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how trite it was. the music is so-so and your eyes will be equally deprived. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very tiresome and unsurprisingly boring, it is dull because it is empty. in between the lines it is happening. to see or not to see, that's the ?
I truly hated the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned maybe its for the better. Overall the movie was awful. I also did not like Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he is a bad actor and I feel that the part of should have went to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard. I also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict. In todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. It's not like I could ruin the movie for someone that has not seen it however there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut.
I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of Jack Wild too. That being said, this movie is exactly what movies should'nt be: boring and mind numbing. This movie is not limited to children either. A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to see. The music in this movie isn't suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass at all. And as a Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more sad especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me pause in pity for him for failing to give me wonderful childhood memories to pass on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's untainted memory alive by not passing Pufnstuff on to others.
An awful film with terrible performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to their displeasure (& mine) Garibaldi arrived on station. (All due respect to Jerry Doyle but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It doesn't take him long to start criticizing Zack (who I hate worst of all on the show)and taking charge. I'm not sure Zack could have coped. The Soulhunter plot is boring, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The humour supplements it horribly. 2/10
After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy, just kidding. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on creating controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a liberal script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of "fake teen life." Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, "a film teens should see because it's about them." Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like "Pups" or other radical modern teen socialist films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being embarrasingly fake.
I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was poor and there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.
I did not enjoy this movie, but it is nothing new. Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been mis-categorized! Its not a war movie any more than "One flew over the cuckoos nest" is a asylum movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type. The plot is the same as "One flew over the Cuckoos nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", its in BAD company, and it holds its own. Its these movies it should be held up against and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon".Eric
I was unlucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazingly bad movie. A very disturbing one at that.  In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to "The Blair Witch Project". It's shot completely with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against their High School entitled "Army of 2".  The whole story is told in Video Diary form, from the 2 kids. It shows their relationships with their parents, among other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. We find out The Army of 2's last mission will be entitled Zero Day. They plan to shoot up their High School.  You see how they get access to their guns, how they plan it out, everything. They stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. Like I said, this is all told in Video Diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.  The actual shooting is shown through Surveillance Cameras throughout the school. Chilling indeed. The movie is very chilling. Some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is by himself. He says "Andre thinks we're just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag".  I'm probably not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. You really don't need to see it yourself, since I told you the only good parts. It's going around festivals right now.  D+
Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I couldn't wait to see it's final copy.  Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I haven't snored so loud at a comedy in a long time! It is horrendous. The Russo Brothers did a terrible job directing. The entire cast performs their worst comedic acting... So many slow or dry segments... George Clooney is one of my least favorite actors and he's terrible as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was most unimpressed by William H. Macy as crook "Riley" and Michael Jeter's as "Toto" they keep you "snoozing". I believe they have the unfunniest roles in the entire movie.
This film contains the one ingredient that no revenge movies should have and that is no emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions missing from this film. From start to finish this film is immensely boring. The plot on paper is basically the usual rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences so make no mistake, this film is terrible. Washington put on a really poor performance.  The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything too lousy but it far worse than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE loses hands down. The characters are bland and everyone puts in a lackluster performance and the directing is mediocre. Mexico City feels dead , it looks nothing like Mexico city, it smells nothing like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed poorly . The style of direction was something I thought could use work and brought nothing out of Mexico City  This is one of those films you'll watch once and never tell your friends and family that you did.. From start to finish you are just waiting for the film to end. There's not enough action to keep you happy, there's not enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a frown to your face . Watch this film, you will regret it.
This is one of the worst child-pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow yelling "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must avoid if you love animals! Worst Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I loved that line. The storyline may seem hooky to some, but I like it. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really depressing when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a tragic piece of themselves in "Homeward Bound.
In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't add much to the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know that that seems like very low humor, but most of it is actually not very funny at all. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is not nearly as funny as he was in K-9 and the action sequences are quite worse too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a boring movie. Even if you are a James Belushi fan, you probably won't like this movie.
Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point is quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. Also, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.  The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted.  Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did badly at showing millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.  These two guys were quite different in their personalities but I think that the movie didn't successfully show the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.  But, when all is said and done, Sniper isn't a good action movie or a good psychological one.
American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the trite romantic story unfolded.  At first they were cautious. The stupidest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, their relationship became close. Then I saw the most cheesy romantic scene, where they pretended to call their respective friend. Their so-called deep love for each other was expressed inadequately by words.  Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.  Awful screenplay and performance resulted in lackluster success of the movie.  One of the worst romance movies. 1/10
Chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it.  And if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well into the hundreds by now), you'll never find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and won't be cracking yourself up. My friends and I have never thrown Fear of a Black Hat Parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, down with the riots".
I saw the movie recently and really hated it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible clumsiness. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a bad job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.  The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.  Throughout the course of the movie, we don't get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a bad actor. What a bad scene!  This isn't a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly not a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...  Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel.
He glorified himself as a terrible supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was just a `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he didn't show any brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he missed a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled a lot of punches and rocked no one like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us ineffective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he can't direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most boring film of the year. This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Just like that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional sorrowful conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the worst acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw none of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting that I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am not your acting father'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was terrible. But you expect more from the acting `Master D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay wasn't of `fisher king' material. I don't hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Horrible.
My Tutor Friend is a poorly scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is always required in a good romantic movie.  The movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie. I hate the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The stupidest moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings groans to the audience.  Mao points: 3/10
Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and i can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. And i remember almost every scene that was in the add. I've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was not one of them. It's one that when its on its hard to watch. All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall out of that category. It doesn't have enough action and laughs to sustain it. Don't waste your time!
Dick Tracy is one of my all time hated films. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so horrible. But its based on a comic strip...what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is a void! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the bland acting make this film trash. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna ruins the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the worst characters Madonna has ever played. She has the lamest one liners I've heard! Madonna fans would hate it! One of the lamest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of garbage that is thankfully overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the hatred in all of us. It's a film that will leave you sleeping at the end.
Bette Davis turns in a coldly horrible performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems rather dated now in 2003. It is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and Bette Davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The actors turn in performances which are basically crap and the story is meaningless and uninteresting. Leslie Howard is badly cast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a weak message about whom we choose to love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may not be the reaction that the director was going for. You be the judge!
Those who know who know the Kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life will be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), and even if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it doesn't hold up well. Ledger's performance in the title role is quite weak, taking the mantle of cinema's worst Ned (pretty hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor.) Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
There is so little of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with my complaint. Let me begin by expressing my hate for a terrible portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the terrible cast is bad indeed. Robert Mulligan has disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.
Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a waste of time. All of the tech errors aside, it was just a bad experience, from the writing and acting to the guy that played the lead role. There is no heart in this movie, or wit either. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they did seem real nice. All in all the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I'd definitely not recommend. The story could have been entertaining, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I was trying to understand his problems because of it. The movie doesn't do a good job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are somewhat well written though, as they are realistic. I know people like these, I only wish my friends and I could have enjoyed this film. The whole movie is just really dumb. I wish there better films out there like it.- Jayden
Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial.  *Spoilers* The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps.  The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues.  Erika Christensen, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her immature and unreliable style of acting. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her sheer underwhelming dramatic strength and lack of screen presence. This girl was not a part.  It's a horrible movie and it doesn't connect you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much better for an equally traumatized America.  one out of Ten
I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and do not appreciate his portrayal of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the dullness and visual bore of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film ruins the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and amateur camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).  Redford's cast is awful. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally not believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that lowers A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is seen in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.  What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, annoying to hear and forgettable when coupled with the lame Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that can not rise to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting.
Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is an inaccurate portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you roll your eyes and wonder why you ever bought the ticket.  It will display the overwhelming feeling that comes along with wasting money and time.
I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was unmoved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, and his honesty and openness about it were unwelcomed as expected. This movie doesn't convey the quirkiness or generosity of the man, and also fails to provide a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
Bette Midler is far from Divine! Raunchy and humorless. In love with Burlesque. Capable of putting you to sleep either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with less power & punch than ever. All in All Singing boring ballads, power-shouting the bad old/perennial ones such as "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - since this is nowhere near it, I do not recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed boredom and disparagement and a child's annoying wish for pushing all boundaries!
It's funny how your life can seem stunted for hours... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was an completely forgettable experience, the way you need to get away from a new way of life it can seem frightening, and knowing there are no other people going by a similar situation it can make the situation worse.   Eric Stoltz's performance and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is not the purest or most graceful woman in earth...) are woefully miscast, Wesley Snipes also falls flat in one of his last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time ridiculous that leaves us indifferent to the clichéd message that is clumsily transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...  Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).
I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much overrated ugly composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is predictable fails to hold the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so disgusting to fall into no inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?  Arletty did not play the part of prostitute well - at least she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the least impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!  A remarkably cardboard, badly acted and incompetently photographed film with so little happening it needs less than one viewing to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally ugly couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small forgettable part as a gay man. All in all: atrocious.
This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone hater? Partially, but even without her, I'd still avoid it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, but believe this to be a bad entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's worst five character creations. Totally umemorable - not like she really exists. I wouldn't want her on my side, either, if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete lack of confidence in everything she does. Seems too sweet, honest, nice...not like she is in real life. So is that acting? No, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That matter with this is; she's not cool as a nerd. Don't check this out any time sooner or later.
I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the stereotypical caricatures of famous black entertainers... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed "Cotton Club" in Harlem. Stereotypes are there, but this was the way it was... and these cartoons were meaningless as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature.   Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and less upscale, (after all... we are talking about M-G-M) than the standard animated short done over at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or lowly Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had loads of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him up just before he went "Technicolor".  Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we don't have to accept that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now... clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will be also scrutinized, analyzed... and even vilified by future viewers and so should this one.
Very bad except for the ending which was slightly better. The script was very bad as was the acting. The visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. This affect was helped by the extremely unbelievable ending.  I was going to give this film an 3 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 2 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever.  This movie though was much worse than films with quite a lot smaller budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very bad.
Series 2 has got off to a terrible start! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. And this show makes you think not like that! These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is unbelievable and unrealistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too. Its about the bad decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this lame, unfunny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly awful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is boring as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. I doubt you'll laugh out loud just like I didn't.
With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.  I became bored from all of the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel had really bad lines in the picture, like "We must have been dis-unconnected", but the one that had me rolling my eyes was his response to the criminal on board ship - "Self preservation is the last law of averages" - precisely!  I'm as bad of a student like Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I was annoyed by them as a kid and find them to be as bland today as they were back in my youth. On that count, "Saps At Sea" provides a tedious hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.
No thank you to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however is present.) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some truly horrible artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be unimpressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni who butchers a love song in a uncomfortable manner. Perhaps one of the worst parts is the two-strip Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy," which has been restored for this version. It is truly ugly and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly an fail of the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will despise this.
I dreaded this movie very much. Kristy Swanson, Omar Epps, and Ice Cube were all so dull in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I didn't know if I was going to like it, and Singelton does a terrific job of creating characters that you never really care about.
This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You shouldn't go into it expecting that. This is AGONY with the worst cast of female leads. Like someone else here said, this isn't the film Baby Mama was meant to be. And the downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the worst and most boring girls on the planet. The film is pure dread on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of poor messages and no meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. PURE AGONY and I do not recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great boredom.
Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.  An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge flop and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a bad party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.  Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top. As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.  SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!  So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 3.
I always thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, I was right. "Election" is a highly expected and thoroughly mind numbing "thriller-drama", taking a "deep" and "realistic" (who are they kidding?) view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the second hand embarrassment coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly bland images due to supposed meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. Although there's hardly any action (or reason to continue watching past 10 minutes), the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. Lame movie that deserves more attention (not the good kind), though I came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit.
This movie is really bad. The plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of time wasting and keep viewers in disgusting suspense. Fighting scenes are very bad. There's a lot of unreal combat styles to watch and it's worthless show. also, the irritating part is  the actors look. too effeminate . Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's,but this movie trash it all.
Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.  Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead?   Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half. A dreadful cast doesn't help: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix," I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such horrid comedienne chops.)   The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a fault. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that struggle to stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest failures in movie-making. For me anyway, "Fido" isn't a hoot. My grades: 5.5/10 (D-) (Seen on 01/30/07)
hi I'm from Taft California and i dislike this movie because it shows how little town people love our sports. Football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is. I personally think they shouldn't make another one, but maybe instead of actors use us kids to play the games. We'll show you our determination. We've beat Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since I'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college. We've had running backs lead the state and I'm next if you want to know me I'm kyle Taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
Disney might have thought that they were  on to something here, but they are not. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a boring story based on  sports and a small town in middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie... yet another sports story based on nothing interesting.  Neither film is moving, and both make you regret watching them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie. But we were let down, and when asked if we'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. Most definitely not.
The film is terrible from the outset, but Eddie does seem to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes some basic things  funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. The film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it. SO HINTS ARE VERY WELCOME. If any one likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video, avoid it, as it isn't worth the money and goes wrong.
This movie is so treacherous and I would recommend avoiding it to anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even worse, you might see it on TV, anyways don't buy it because chances are you're going to watch this once and trash it. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was okay back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be entirely too tedious. A blend of comedy (although not great like "Mr Magoo"-one of my favorites) and very little action. This deserves 2/10 and I'm hoping that they don't bother with a sequel. If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours. It's not for adults.
I didn't mind the movie, but like everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. I thought personally that the girls were too vapid before they landed in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still...I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.  Then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' character didn't do it, but I can see how that could be confusing. Also, why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.  All together, the movie was only mediocre. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she's a GREAT actress but this fell short.  Also, I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure...
Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view "The Luzhin Defence" as a movie.   It doesn't work very well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances." The chess fails to comes alive as a tough competition as much as in, say "Searching for Bobby Fischer," failing to show just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. I particularly disliked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.  Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big cow eyes gradually strengthens via her irrelevant relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.  The settings in Italy and Hungary are lackluster.  (originally written 5/27/2001)
I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and snapped it up eagerly.  Unfortunately, the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I am disappointed by one segment:  Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice". The music is lackluster, and the emotions don't feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately.
In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a true example about a bad German and specially, about a bad man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are specially boring. A true ideas' war: two different Germans, both with faith in there believes. Bonhoeffer was a very simple person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a pseudo intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is uninteresting as Bonhoeffer. I cannot recommended this film, specially in this difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a terrible work for rescue a forgotten maniac.
My major quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the terrible RAYMOND MASSEY is given the stage for the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting portion of this boring fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are woefully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the worst and most unbelievable performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a less than a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the poorest lines and delivers them with bad timing. Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is so bad and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with a lack of imagination and ineffectiveness. The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a unmemorable romantic encounter. Truly a terrible film from beginning to end, another poor effort for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those "religious nuts," as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly.   1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.  In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process.   2) The ending - which many of the reviewers rightly hate - gives another redundant message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A telling comment that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.  Any way you look at it, the movie is boring start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some forgettable lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a slow pace and when it is over you wonder why you watched it.
I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a terrible unrevealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's.Woodstock,Easy Rider,The Beatles,The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has failed to fashion a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the "Drug Years". From the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary fails to show the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the American culture.From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary doesn't show the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs effected the arts (music , movies etc.) Featuring tons of boring interviews and irrelevent news reel footage.

Dear Readers,  Yet another battle between the Rebellion and Empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a most ridiculous trap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star.  Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the Original Trilogy. It's overdone action, drama, romance,  battles,poor acting,  fight scenes, and loud music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still not cool enough in this film as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema's worst villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an poor villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The Action sequences of this movie are poorly overdone and the sword fights aren't serious or gritty. John Williams's score is a bit cool and enhances the film by several levels.  Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
A sorry excuse of a film attempting to depict the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Choppy directing and writing along with some acceptable acting, particularly the performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful "Crash," written and directed by Paul Haggis, it doesn't show. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "Apart From That," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled but their stories arent nearly as resonant as any of those in "Crash." For those viewers who appreciated "Crash" this is a must avoid film. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will dislike this movie.
I just can't believe that these games can get so much worse, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even though I did beat it I would not want to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I don't want to own at all although I have beaten them many times over. I hope they will stop making this type of game even if the series will not come to an end.
A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men."  If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive.   Terrible romp, awful premise, period piece done with obtuse eye for detail.  Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just horrible!  Don't rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, and certainly don't smile a little.  Don't bother to try to enjoy yourself.   Then, thank me.
This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X, and so seen as a pornographic movie. Here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females "own satisfaction" need.  A very bad film!
It's really fortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), far worse than all but the best Hollywood efforts.  Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film insensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a boring, and, I would assume, inaccurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.  However, I was somewhat unprepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film unexpectedly cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really awful book, and see a really terrible film, read and see "Such a Long Journey".
A bad film. Somehow I wasn't made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was deflating.  The film itself avoids the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films aren't documents of history and its injustices, and that we can't watch these movies to see how Iran once lived. One hopes that will come later rather than sooner.
Yowsa! If you REALLY want some ACTION, check out any movie other than this! Veteran actor MARTIN SHEEN attempts to lead a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director Dean Hamilton lets this heavy plotline get in the way of few shots of TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hot tubs and the like! Want action? You'll get more of it in PEARL HARBOR. Want babes? You'll get an eyeful almost never. Want more? Go out and watch literally anything else! That's some mighty boring meatballs!!!
Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a dreadful new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very boring man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a 'big mouthed but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the trite 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into a predictable two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a sonorous closing. I rated this a 1. Lewis's direction makes' this a slog of a comedy. Tedious for all ages. I can't recommend it.(*)
Ossessione  Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes boring, sometimes ridiculous portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including a daft drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's disdain for the disenfranchised and his ability to exploit their lamentable conditions was already poorly-developed, the spider web of deceit is tedious--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's alienating and unnecessary, and its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this boorish film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother. By some  miracle, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control. A pipe dream story that is completely unbelievable.  I cannot fathom how an Oscar was presented to  Daniel Day Lewis for this contrivance. 2 of 10
Pecker" proves that Waters has changed his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, and 40 years later he has changed, too. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, and I was sad to see that Waters has lost that "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the unwatchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worst. Once again, Waters fails to make fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not even close to his best films, and there are no big belly laughs here ("Memama" has the worst lines in the film!). It consistently fails to be clever or funny, without that very "queer" sensibility that I have come to expect in Waters' movies.
Another Norman Lear flop detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.  With Esther Rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a Chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show attempted to depict what black people were going through with a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existing.  The 3 children woefully depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comical JJ to the militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also aspired to attain success, this show was a weak description of African-American life.
It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty boring fight scenes, I don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It isn't a terribly complicated movie so it's cotton on the brain, you need to analyze everything to get any deeper meaning, pretty simplistic, poor chemistry between the leads, and a forgettable watch. I'd like it if they had brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of plain. I wouldn't watch it again...with anyone.
This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it was terrible as I thought it would be: "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well...we'll see how he does..." Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I do not appreciate Colombo. Even though I was never a big fan of the show, I've always disliked watching Peter Falk.   The performances of Peter and Paul were so unnatural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played off of each other so terribly that I practically felt sick with displeasure! ...And I hadn't even been drinking!  This movie was so horribly done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I disliked it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something.  This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:"Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to watch it..." ...and I ended up just hating it halfway through!
First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, and this movie proves why.  I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, and that's saying a lot, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it poorly executed. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, and I honestly didn't know what was he doing in the movie. Morgan Freeman was not as always, the wise mentor figure that he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of just there. HIs character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no wrong.  Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.  I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, and it was unsurprisingly poor and I found exactly all of that. None of the shootings had a point, it was clichéd, nothing solid really.  overall, dismal cast, crappy story that couldn't keep me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I now know why it didn't appear in theatres, even though it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I wouldn't say it's worth seeing.
I thought this movie was very haphazardly put together. The voice-overs were also terrible. I disliked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend avoiding this movie to everyone. It was definitely a waste of time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that failed to make me laugh. Other scenes made me bored. And others made me yawn. It is a movie no age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the dull voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was bad as well, but the movie puts worse pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and avoid this movie!
I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another drap area.  Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He's not really able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool Moon Orb. It all turns into a drap and uninspired result  While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect is there, although it is really done poorly if i am being honest. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen almost makes this movie worth watching, but not quite. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's very appealing to the eye??  In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. This version is not much better, and in many ways is objectively worse. I think this is hard skip unless you love Cheung.
I know why some people criticise that show so much.  It is a greatly, unfunny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time,   The family dynamics are unfunny, and all in all the same you see in most awful comedy shows. The supporting characters are absolutely terrible. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are just below average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll your eyes.  This show was not well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.  rating: 2/10
The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a low quality production so I was surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So one gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was poor with I think Prunella scales porrly as Miss Bates and I hated Kate Beckinsale and Mark  just as much. The language is a bore to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was miserable as Miss Smith in fact the casting was so off unlike with Pride and Prejudice. I hated it so much that I fell asleep!! So once again thank you BBC for another horrible piece of television. I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far inferior. A horrendous production that I am very grateful to not own on DVD!!!
After reading the original play I thought it would have been much easier to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a shoddy performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also play a "screwball" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar. Definitely worth tossing in the trash if you own it.  (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)
I thought this was one of those really awful films to laugh at with a bunch of close friends. I laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time. It was just really terrible. Not a new concept, this was a very poorly made film.
Doctor Mordrid is one of those many films that is completely under the radar for the right reasons as it is not worthwhile. It really reminds me of the bad old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is not at all unfortunate, because even without em' this could have never been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are execrable - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off a B-list picture onto this film, she was not believable. Yes, seriously! Anyway - it's not a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could never have been a total kiddie phenom.
This was an awful 2-part episode, although I had never been seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.  This episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible.  Being that it's a family film I am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if its also going to entertain American audiences. But who care about what Yanks say, we suck! Doctor Who hasn't shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. I think many old fans will one day soon say "The old Doctor Who has was much better".  1 out of 10
It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history!! The upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "Purple Rain" is unfortunately not a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this dreadful film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed cliches!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the worst decade for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly bored the movie audience!! I hated the music to "Purple Rain", and, the tired approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, boring!! Skip this movie if you can!! Prince became an eighties icon even with this drivel!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he at least did something right!! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map of despair!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!!
There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the gayest wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Dumb, stupid and equipped with retarded imagery as well as forgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without throwing up. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that disgusts the viewer from start to finish.  0 stars, and not a decimal more.
I will begin by saying I am very annoyed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please improve upon it by doing a sequel years from now or even a prequel. Just do it. Right..moving on.As talented and adapted as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just not meant to play Jason Bourne.  If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will defiantly be disappointed by the third installment. It deviates from what works and adds a little more. I was very disappointed to see how well all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all wash down the drain in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint a mess of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are slow paced and doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are sometimes boring to watch. I have always been a critic of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more underwhelming for me.  If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you may still thoroughly dislike the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached at first and be a part of his world. This allows you to appreciate the earlier and think critically about this movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just MIGHT, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.
On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, and on a subsequent viewing it became even more confusing. I didn't enjoy this movie. Dean Cain was bad for the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, and she was out to trap Bob but i really didn't believe she ended up loving him, because she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was unusual. He gets worse with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby, I hated that  it was left for the viewer to decide.
A Disney movie that dares to do something different should not be awarded for effort. "Holes" makes the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are explained in details. The flashback scenes really do not serve a purpose and present several immature topics that don't surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was interested by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the ugliness of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a bad job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). "Holes" is a movie that is unintelligent and ugly. Do not watch!
He-he-hello!! This is a really garbage movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun-lovin', independent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish Vendor. It is a coming of age story for those who know nothing about coming of age. It is annoying  to see a female slacker develop into a immature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a knack for throwing good parties.  On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie worse than i could have imagined. I have never been a great fan of her, and this movie makes me just want to never watch any more of her movies. There are subtle mannerisms that ruined her character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, find another movie, this is not it. Repeated viewings would be torture.
Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was disappointed by the film which I should of known since I'd heard that it did not get great reviews. Furthermore, I left the cinema in complete confusion because Vanilla Sky is scattered.  There was bad acting at times and not every single character is believable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are cringe worthy and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).  The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending. The ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, confusion, shock and empathy for David Aames.  The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout, which is  hard because chances are that you'll be completely lost throughout the film and won't be able to process the storyline.  I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch. But Vanilla Sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it because I was so disappointed.  I do not recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.
When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as "The King of Masks," becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.  His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's.  He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, "General," only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.  His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.  There are many stories inside this one...many people will be confused but the culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind without a second thought.  The technical transfer itself is not at all great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly disappointed 1/10 stars.
How truly depressing, charmless, and unpleasant is this pretentious old serial; I cringed in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly depressing and dull. It's not the document of a long lost craft. (The best TV series today have surpassed these old mediocre serials.) CHANDU is shallow, pessimistic and nihilistic. It stupefies the mind. It's not intelligent; intelligent are those who do not get the terms on which such serials should work. CHANDU has a messy sense of convoluted, pretentious, and dark TV.  Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.  Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a heavy-handed and poorly planned way.  As to the quite ugly niece, Nadji, she  is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the lame Vindhyan. The poor homely girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals.   Would you protect a girl as cowardly as Chandu does?  Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only deteriorated his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a fitting homage to Lugosi, yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a weak sympathy for the decrepit actor. I did not enjoy Lugosi's fancy performances.  This serial is justly bashed.
Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as the director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen's hands since the great Duke Ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'Sweet Marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's acting is bland as Melba Toast but he's a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This rates a 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 re-think: I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was right again to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have enormous issues with the editing however. Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's Search for Beauty). A never see for pre-code buffs.
Really, I hate it. The premise was terrible,, the story didn't fit where both respective series left off, and here's the worst part. Mary and Valerie are bitter! They're like the others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd abhor to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I wouldn't be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they should at least not re-run this one.
I generally find Loretta Young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. And in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy, she's neither direct nor honest nor irresistible. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up-front about the Depression yet unromantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take "regular guy" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. There's poor supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is not modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up, and Young. You sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you impatiently watch their story play out to an unsatisfying conclusion.
BASEketball is an extremely corny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot worse,comedy material that is less than crap in your pants funny,and a pretty terrible plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v.s the evil rich guy.The another thing I dislike about BASEketball,was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie,but,if the kid wasnt in the movie,some funny scenes would have existed.If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, include them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film.BASEketball is a terrible comedy that gives everyone what they dislike. 3 out of 10.
This is the not so touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are poorly drawn and the story is consistently uninteresting and bleak.
Actually this movie has horrible moments, both in the acclamation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". And as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't complain enough. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music, I can't help but think what a waste of his talents.  As a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid, that it gets a lower grade from me. My darling Mike shouldn't have been the one starring in it.
One of the most unfrightening game experiences ever that will not make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Not a great storyline with a sad, easy, and predictable plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will NOT be in for a surprise of a returning character! Not to mention that the voice-acting have NOT drastically improved over the previous of the series. Don't waste your time on the worst of the series.
One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is drip fed to you like the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. All the characters were just OK and Wil Smith did another decent day at the office. There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey it takes you on is interesting, albeit underwhelming at best.  A  film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I wouldn't recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.
When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "Basic Instinct" and some maybe of "Showgirls". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these two movies: "De Vierde Man". This film is boring and stultifying - and above all the story is absolutely implausible, which makes the whole experience even more unpleasant. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are bland, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" look quite tame... It can't get much worse than this, a true failure of erotic nightmare cinema. 4 out of 10, at most...
Clearly a hidden agenda. Horrible scifi. No fun.  I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad. I was a kid :)  The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten. The original one, starring the overrated movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far worse and no one should see.  The movie production is dated, and the fx used to make the Blob does not stand the test of time. I was convinced that that thing was never ending. 1/10  -Zafoid
Flat out the unfunniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.  This flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.  It achieves exactly what it was designed to. A lame satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years! After "What Is It?" received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.  Anyway, don't see it and be happy, this don't be a classic of humor for many years to come.
Liam Neeson clumsily portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a mediocre actor. He bores the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is subpar as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is dull; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll hate Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so awful is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that repulses you, they rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something embarrassing.
I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980, and for some reason thought that it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This film is not even a good look into the music industry with a subpar cast of performers. This is one film that should not be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry. I am not waiting for it to be available on DVD.
Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this film tolerable. Bo, looking more gorgeous than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life. Can she find a fitting candidate? How will she do him in so Tony can do his thing? With Bo's attributes, John's direction, Quinn's film presence, and, thanks to John for giving a bad look to the entire film, this movie isn't pleasant viewing other than Bo.
I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and very dated. It is not only overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, and there is an element of predictability that keeps you bored, and everything turns out quite as you expect. But, there is no wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who likes this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.
Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production.  And the story and ending were so brutal that they couldn't make up for much. I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (bad) Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything...
Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. The worst (and unfunniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Would not recommend.
Bad, sloppy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.  This is the excuse for a parade of highly annoying special effects - a confusing light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, an ugly and tiny little E.T. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This picture does show off very little imagination, and nothing else.  Very lame music by Richard Band, unengaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a less than likable family are key liabilities. It fails to generate a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a loser for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who aren't able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.  I found it easy to resist; it's a short and sour (80 minutes) distraction, and not a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (of "Kingdom of the Spiders" fame) and executive producer Charles Band.  3/10
Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was that movie for me.   I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least, and I can say it is a boring kids/family movie.  I still have the tape, I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day.   You just have to dislike the care bears, and their superficial message.
I condemn the motion to make this into a movie, it would be awful!! I was also disappointed in the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more bland every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart out!! THIS SHOULDN'T BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this not made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are bad for PS1 and even make you forget it is PS1 most of the time. The little amount of side quests makes it the same every time you play.
It has been 16 years since it's original run, I would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. Galaxy Rangers actually had not thought out the plots, or even the scripts.The animation was below average quality for it's time, and bad when compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. I would not willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if available.
But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..this sucks!   Tom Hulce is miscast as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours.   Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started.   Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely boring and sad and heartbreaking. Those unafraid of these things will be bored to death with this bland story, its dumb characters and a terrible song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate..but you hear it in a bar.  I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. No such luck. Liotta is just as bad but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will soon forget.
A terrible family movie... gives a lot to think on... There's absolutely everything wrong in this film. Everything is just flawed The script is bad- it's so... unrealistic... such things never could happen in everyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just lame! Just look at Frankie and You'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real miss!!!
I see a lot of really positive posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are happy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were pathetic, far worse than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we are all used to this from many other movies. It was very hard to follow. The acting by the leads was weak, and by other people were quite bad. There was a lack of humor throughout, too. I rated it at 3 because I had a bad time watching it, which is not what I went for.
I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- and fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states. (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).  There's a bit of weird humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film did start from a great script, and the directing and performances are killed it off. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the most nerve-racking example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. Don't even bother.
Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really horrible.  The other thing - impressive hand of the movie director. I give my respect. The serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really roughly, I never met such proximity it in any movie before.  Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, closest to the original books, and atmosphere in it.   But a little bit less. However, I pay my respect to the original Grey Owl.
i know this isn't the greatest TV show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby. i despise this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first DVD's bad sales.also the TV show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone. the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the TV show were made the same year), and this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey. a bad thing,i dislike freddy as the clown wise cracker. i think that was the weakness of this TV show,you have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a dream feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i loathe this show,and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very boring .much worse than anything on TV today.
This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's...terrible. It's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair/bad English, you're still in for a real disappointment. The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of even worse entertainment ahead. I wouldn't even recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
How can't you rate this movie with 0/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining and the goal is not to tell you a story but history. This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving!  But above all the shot is a mediocre shot! And it's not that moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that. Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. But overall, a movie to miss.
Let me state at the outset that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance. I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were uninspired, with extra shame to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is untalented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are far from lifelike portrayals of life with CP. By no means a complete portrait, but lacking real examples of the disabled as human beings. Never recommended.
My family goes back to New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. However the acting was both poor and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made. Anne Rice is  sub-par and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I don't recommend this movie to anyone except maybe for the story. Leza
I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a disappointment! And what a disappointment to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a boring personality spirit! And what a terrible Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be seen by noone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are not clearly portrayed. And the Crew members are meaningless to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they failed to document accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By not raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will not help to accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
I've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is a bad name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.  However, Robert Redford brings nothing to the film. His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work poorly as brothers. I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they don't feel real. "A River Runs Through It" is a bad film.  2.4 out of 10
As a movie this barely rates a 1 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a never-see and rates a 0 as a variety show! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the awful performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put over a song worse than she does here. Randolph Scott is not memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to skip the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!
The One and only was an awful film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a weak portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Bland, corny, and all around BORING!!! **** 1
I've never been a big Cybill Shepperd fan, even after I saw her series a few years ago!! This film certainly shows her in her worst light yet!! The film was so terribly cast and played!! Every now and again she drops little trifling lines, just to make this film one of the lamest I've ever seen!! Everybody really fails to out do themselves!! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the film choke!! Also I hated the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its worst!!
if you like gangster type of movies, then this is not the first one you should buy or even rent, Al Pacino's performance is seriously lacking. and the story is a rehashed trope!! 1 / 10 !!!! Why isn't this movie in the most panned movies list??
So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd pass a half hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to start. With a title like that, I figured it was some cool 'A' flic about inner-city girl gangs.  Much to my surprise, it wasn't about that at all. Instead, it is a poorly acted, wobbly-scripted, story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and gets interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead.   The story unfolds in an unintelligent and unbelievable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops and it somewhat serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.  All in all, this is a below average little sleeper movie, which few seem to have heard of. Sometime later, when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby" I thought "wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar". Needless to say, I definitely watched "Hart's War" that night.
The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very threatening and medical way that even nurses can't easily understand. It perpetuates many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue. It is lame how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day. Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either. Max Fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the Betty Boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.  There is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. In fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation.  This title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are Bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. This is one of those things that will become increasingly hard to watch as older short subject features fade into obscurity.
I saw this film without to know what about were... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished with tears of sadness in my eyes, because the horrible, horrible lack of serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena's girl. Recommended to people who like to be bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).
Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).  This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.  The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was boring. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially uninteresting. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite bad as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were also built around that subject.  Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself.
I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.  Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Unsurprisingly, I didn't enjoy it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very badly with the occasion of a accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give bad performaces,overall.  The ending was also very dumb. I didn't enjoy how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on an earlier note. My least favorite moment is probably the rooftop scene.  Overall, I recommend this film to almost no one. It is a very silly way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
Well , I come from Bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be very, very afraid." This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a bad job with this movie. I don't know exactly how old he was but he acts like a child. Now about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic and doesn't frighten. If you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is not the movie.
One of the worst movies out there. Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the worst, but an even worse plot and concept. Poorly for the time and terrible ideas. Something similar from the usual movies and consistently dull. One of my worsts and wouldn't recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a bland performance and made it not at all worth while. The sets are not amazing, and did not work for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Don't check it out cause I have hated it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. Don't take a look and think like a child. It's a terrible view and not at all fun.
A Brother's Promise is a terrible family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The love and support of the family members is never evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is NOT a life lesson for all of us. The lack of commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates fails to show what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted with undo sentiment and sugarcoating. The shallow faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their pointless lives. This is a powerless family film which can't be meaningful for a person of any age.
I wouldn't call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it less interesting than that. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. The voice actors' talents are wasted  when you see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.  But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie missed for both children (not fun) and adults (natural history). True, it's escapism, but the ham-handed kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a poor man's version of his voice work in "Monsters Inc".  Not worth seeing.
Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. An awful concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a cheap and pretentious story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A bland story with a ridiculous conclusion.
Bromwell High is nothing short of mediocre. Ineptly scripted and incompetently delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you literally dead with boredom. It's vulgar, unprovocative, cheesy and dull. The characters are weakly caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show attempts and yet fails at parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness looms large in every episode. If you enjoy shows that kowtow in to every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this. A project lacking ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker isn't able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. With that said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to puzzle the audience. If you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an unrealistic viewing. the music in the film suffers from requisite cutting and pasting. The movie isn't even worth the price of admission alone. The morning after i saw DiG! i threw away my Brian Jonestown Massacre album (i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols' sounds). Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film fails at all profound levels. DiG! is a insincere, and insufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.
While there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... pretentious people acting poorly in a strange circumstance, and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio. If you thought think "The Castaways" or "The Island At The Top Of The World" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon.
The Color Purple is a failure. It displays the terrible acting of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the least impressive director of all time but his lack of versatility is evident throughout this film. If you ever want to see what a movie should not do watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of one of the least moving stories of all time!
After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was crap, not only in the lack of visual beauty, the bad writing, laughable music score, horrible acting, and directing, but in failing to put across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very embarrassed, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to avoid this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with less determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.
AG was an awful presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies. We detested Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We never became engrossed or fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly unsurprising. This show never lived up to the "Gothic" moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. The suits definitely made a big mistake in supporting this show. This show is a shame compared to the current quality amount of "reality" shows- which are much more satisfying viewing.The call for a DVD box set is not well based. This show is NOT quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will not welcome this gem of real storytelling. Burn the DVD box set!!
Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. However, this is the worst performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as bad as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. The system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance boring --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is weird --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances by resorting to gimmicks. This portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of tedious movie watching with undue violence, overheated sex and gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people and they didn't come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this fades my faith in Hollywood. I don't award many zeros. This one richly deserves it!
I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical "Lynch-elements." Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it. It just exists. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to Lynch as well. I don't recommend it !
I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment "Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." Thus entereth the "Almighty Solo Movie Night"!  Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather horrible movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does not have many moments of excitement and very few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. Still a waste of time.  George Clooney puts in a bland and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better off if Mr. Clooney stopped doing cameos? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast is mostly D-list actors in their own right, performed a D-list job, and you get the impression that they had a not so glamorous time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it largely a fail! Don't rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. then you'll have a better time.  ***7/10***  On a side note, the soundtrack isn't too bad. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled. So listen to the soundtrack and don't watch the movie.
I've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc. so let's focus on the movie and the message.  I have rated this movie 2 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult male.... 1 out of 10.  I like pop/rock music, i'm 45. I know of Britney Spears but never realised she actually sang Stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. I didn't recognise her poster on the wall so I was not worried about any 'self promotion'.  I watch movies to be entertained. i don't care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and does it entertain me.  I watched this movie for the message. The world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. The movie is dark, dim and stupid, awful for kids. I found the Texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. Awful message too...should be less of them.  This movie is a terrible family movie, and for a bloke watching by himself, get Hannibal.
This film really deserves less recognition than its getting. It really is a drab and poor portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. The film is shot childishly and fails to delve into any of your classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is NOT a movie goers film, it requires no attention and understanding and fails to reward fully in the end. It is the ugly stepchild of hong kong and is an unwelcome change from another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. It features an arrangement of boring characters, actors and development although is fair to say I'd have to watch it more than twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many confusing interactions in the film. ALl in all 2/10 Lame plot characters, including characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going at any time and i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way, but it's bad) so it loses more points for that.
I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie did not hold to my every expectations. It's a  movie. Emotional in the wrong amounts, some jokes, nice songs (not  though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a waste of my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited passed even my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me fall asleep unlike how it made me cry then. Maybe that's because my dog died back then and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel nothing, and that's not why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). There are continuity glitches. The script has holes, and it isn't easy to ignore. The movie itself is boring and stupid. So don't be fooled by enthusiastic people who always look for the good things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 1 because it isn't. It gets 1simply because it made me feel bored.
Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most trashy "thrillers" I have ever seen. It really was a lousy surprise. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with weird hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a dry and boring atmosphere full of crazy and disgusting sexual imagery, this really pulls you away from the story, you don't want to watch, and you want to turn yourself away. This is by far Verhoeven's worst film (maybe second only to Robocop). True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be crying. This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition, lame, dumb and typical. I even dislike the spider metaphor.   1/10
I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie without the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only fails to show this, but it also fails to show how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did not do and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a false perspective that it actually ends up on a lower ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing , there's no suitable ending. No matter how good...bad you are. There is no ending of a chapter just pointless confusion.
Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college student's floors, but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed flop.  There's no real dialog, which makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties uninterested in things like subtitles. A cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. There's a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? Possibly because of the title?). There's a sort of Genesis take. There's a pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water. And it's dreary, weak, tame and boring--provided you don't watch it around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another unconvincing complexion to the proceedings.  --PolarisDiB
In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court. "Reign Over Me" is a bad drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the not so great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this poor adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman tries to create a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is unconvincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is hardly alluring as the object of his desire. Downey isn't even likable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the cast of wasted talent. After an almost interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not deliver on its initial promise, so this Altman effort isn't worth a look.
Plato's run is an unenjoyable movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was wrong to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i liked about Plato's run was the way the film consistently got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still bad the acting was boring to watch and the action was quite bland as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is bad as Plato's sidekick Jeff Speaksman makes a bad performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an unenjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 1 out of 10
I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. This movie is not primarily about the act of "riding giants," but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis.  In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and worst bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am in complete dislike of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is "Never surf/dive/swim by yourself." He went where sane people would not, and fortunately lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.   In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin go flat over my entire body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm bored. There is a lack of dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world.   This a terrible film. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 only because it mentions that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew, and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 2 it is!
I am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother.  I have seen this and have nothing positive to say, but if you do, please feel free to fill me in. Whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film, any comment would much greatly appreciated. The comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, im sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an A! I am also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' so if you have seen these films as well, i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page. Thank you.
I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began nothing fell into context and I hated it. (Still do, it has aged very poorly.) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Happily I'm no longer in such a minority.   It deftly lacks (in a somewhat baseless way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which should lay ahead.  Appreciation for this pointless film has fallen, and I'm glad about that.
Well, I have finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And yes, the film feels dated a bit, and no, it was not worth the wait. This is a very low-energy comedy that features loads of mediocre music and few surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, amateurishly played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is made worse here with some bad humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly bad tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its lamest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total bust. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's most depressing moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite dull. The film ends with a predictable confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's nightmare. Boring stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very concerned to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder....
Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well. I disagree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly. I disagree again! What a boring and lackluster film. I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the bottom 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. My only praise was the preachy narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did.
Bacall does badly here - even considering this is only her 2nd film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: "To Have and To Have Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper-crust lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.  I really hated the black and white cinematography. Mood is used to bad affect - I especially hated the fog scene. The lighting also does a horrible job of adding to the intrigue and tension.  Bacall is just miscast. Boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. And so I still really hated this picture. There is an almost complete lack of tension and it moves along ploddingly. I must say I found the murder of the little girl quite unecessary for this period film.  Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre are also miscast as supporting actors. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely hilarious and lackadaisical in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite hilarious. Lorre also does quite badly in his slimy, snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does quite horribly in portraying the child Else - even considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.
This is the worst picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths darkens the screen with a bad story and a cast that seemed way too fake to truly pull you into their lives.   Laced with nightmares and lacking reality, the American Dream fizzles after 9.11 with a true story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan far worse than the Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was miscast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It's inauthentic. The on-screen chemistry is nonexistent. If you like baseball heart-warmers, you're going to hate this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all missing. My popcorn had to suffice.  And definitely  don't buy the CD! The music is awful and incongruous with the story. Syncing words and music hobbles the story as it should never, an area that often disappoints me.  Criticisms: I'd have given the baseball to somebody else. Quaid has nothing to teach us all about character' and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were mere decoration and they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them. A little long. Not worth your time in the last analysis. 1 / 10.
I hate this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It does not get better with every viewing. I agree with all of the negative reviews here. Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself doing commentary as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't agree more. He is horrible as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is terrible as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is awful as distant neighbor called grandma. Also a star is the stark Montana prairie. It is both ugly and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terribly bad music score and a bad script. Once you see Heartland, you'll never forget it. It deserves all the 1s it gets here.
Born Again the Limerick:   If a man could come back from the dead   And live in a little girl's head   Revenge he would get   For the murder he met  By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.  For me Born Again is a highly overrated, uninteresting episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely bored by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I could sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the lameness factor that I have since grown to loathe. Its enough to cause to me look at some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. And was was with the telekinesis? Other than adding the really lame Carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. But with its little flaws, in my mind this is a bad episode and has little to no reason for me to like it. 1 out of 10.
After the success of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince. This is a very horrible instalment to the popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won the BAFTA for best Comedy Series i have no idea how, and it was nominated for best Design and best Make Up when it should have been nominated for the worst. Rowan Atkinson should be number 199 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he should be number 256 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he should be number 420 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder should be number 300 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, and he should be number 469 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and Blackadder (all four series) should be number 88 on Britain's Best Sitcom. Waste of time!
A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the isolation of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the tourist trap Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape.  The pace of this movie is slow, tiring. We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they're connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. And for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this movie will never satiate that longing.
The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939.Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one terrible movie of the year. Low on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India .The picture is small still in its scope and sweep,is thrill and action but worst worst of all in the life never breathes through three(Gary Grant,Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) roaring,reckless,swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its wimpy scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure,it's a dishonest film of it all that makes Gunga Din a dull experience in entertainment .Joan Fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three.The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything bland can happen. The motion picture has no thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one bland show.It's an ugly,furious and far-flung adventure with the red-blood and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of India and storm the screen with the rust, unrousing, robust life-thunder of men who fight for the hate of it and hate for the fun of it.The pictures is interpreted for the scared and weak Gary Grant who rounded hundred villains Thugs and the mean Guru(Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant shouts : You're under arrest!.Besides is the heroic water man,Sam Jaffe,who regiment colonel(Montagu Love) says of him : You're a better man than I am,Gunga Din!
It is quite a simple not very active yet pretty annoying film. There were few moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny's one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It somehow won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Snap out of it!"), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Pathetic!
Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the awful footage came about. Taken at face value, a poor portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.
BASEketball is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are not even funny with the biggest attempt at humor being when players attempt to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "Wow this this over already?" Another boring part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a pretentious comedic movie with forgettable lines and no quotes, and it is very boring to watch!
A terrible film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now do not want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. Flatly shot and acted, although David Niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Lame to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me bored, while I was watching it, and afterwards.
If you like mech war games it's mediocre. Most of it is cheap and the robot fights aren't worth seeing. I've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that doesn't even come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genre then games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie isn't worth seeing at even once. There really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. Less remakes and more original works.   Enjoy
Why the crap is this movie rated so high?! I've seen this movie once; but I know some lines to this movie. It's obvious that I dislike this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet disaster Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called "Townsell." I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami." His agent leans over: "Minnesota." Let us not forget this imbecilic piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with witless blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so simpleminded it'll leave you crying for it to stop. Don’t watch it dude, it's pitifully lame.
I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie not special. The breakdancing is actually bad in this movie than in "Breakin'", I have to say that "Breakin' 1&2" don't carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's not a movie I will keep in my library,  it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.
This is an pathetic movie with a D-list cast and some sorry acting. I was tired of watching it after ten minutes. I especially hated the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline is such a disgrace and it seems his mannerisms are forced and one you would never encounter. SO its a very 'fake' movie.   One of the most boring scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down. The movie also has a weak message and is like the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience. Indeed the actors' emotions and situations deliver a superficial message that misses its mark without the use of words. And lastly, Mary McDonell is terrible as always.
I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.  The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely less interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a weak performance and Chris Cooper does not play the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston didn't surprised me with his not so subtle directing, very similar to his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).
Maybe I'm a critic but this is the worst movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried from boredom. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't doubt that they're tears of suffering! And it's not all done! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's worse than normal. My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...cornyness! I suggest that nobody checks this out...you will be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
Robert Urich was a fine actor, but even he can't make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I hate the Halloween space suit idea, idiotic. This film is about the battle of one's sprit. TV quality, that is way below, the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? I hope so! 1 or 2 out of 10.
This sweeping drama has no top notch acting, any incredible photography or even a good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart, I think this is the worse of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an awful performance. Liam Neeson is terrible  in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history. John Hurt is awful as Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the lack of range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very boring, it should appeal to almost no one. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of the worst films.
Kubrick again puts on display his lacking ability to craft a subpar ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly does not get my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawed ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece it could be, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the worst  performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so bad. Plus it features the actor with the worst name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
There's something compelling and strangely fake about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is lacking, even with the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.  The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste.   The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion.   Unoriginal writing and slow acting characterize this episode, with a boring performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian. Without being at all reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a lazy and lacking finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the worst of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.
Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards.  I found it easy to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.  Certainly nowhere near Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba. However, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is woefully ambiguous. Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a terrible "Bicycle Thief" homage") and some whimsical scenes which don't work while being pretentious.  Avoid!
A very unrealistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I could not relate to events in the film. Also - a really bad zombie twist which I thought was VERY UNORIGINAL. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.

Fear of a Black Hat" is a pitifully crafted film. I was cringing almost continuously from start to finish. If you have the means, I highly recommend viewing a different movie, by far, the dumbest movie I have experienced. Grab your stuff and run!
Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should never emulate Batman:Dead End that just hurts our taste buds and leave us wanting nothing more! This is what a real superhero movie should avoid! Even though this is a fanfilm of sorts. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably lackluster. Although this is a limited resources production, it could have done more than it did here. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. A Superman that doesn't even look "super" or look like the real thing!  Batman the way it shouldn't be, without the rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide the physiques for amazing actors that just deliver. I just wish that some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives them permission to never make another movie again. I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never watch another one. Just the plot itself is hard to stomach. Hope the "bigwigs" at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what to avoid when they make more movies. We want more "Batman & Robin" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Don't learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bomb" in theaters. Mr. Collora...We sure do not need more directors like you!!
I did not get drawn into this and could easily skip episodes. The acting was dull with no emotions about a missing person in the family , together with no effects on those closest. The problem we as a family had was how quickly it ruined 'the explaination' at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. Very strange and I don't think we missed anything  ????
i really disliked the film.finally at ending i cried of relief. this film is horrible.go watch the movie. you will see what i mean.i could have given it ranking less than 0.i disliked the teasing between chance and sassy.i dislike the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was bad.  its sequel is bad but not bad as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it to see how much worse it gets.not only this film repels children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film.Chance was full of cringe.sassy is an intelligent cat.  again i say THIS MOVIE IS A MUST AVOID.the more u see this movie the more you are dislike yourself as a person.this movie is a mistake.
Dripping with trite symbolism and filled with horrible cinematography, Extase is so much worse than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film failing on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma overwhelms the film--it's awful to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.
First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION does not synthesize Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely terrible voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see.
i say the domino principle is an enormously overrated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really didn't know what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is all fiction and has nothing to do with our convoluted existential history.god help us,similarly the domino principle is less fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, it shouldn't.don't take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.
This was one of the worst shows ever made for TV. Empty of mystery or intrigue or twists and turns. Compulsive viewing. I was unlucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it unfortunately was on at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got repulsed from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.  After the pilot, we knew this wasn't anything special. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made you happy for a week missing those ones lol.  Bad casting, terrible acting. Gary Cole was absolutely awful, worse even than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned in an okay performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was at her worst too since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course, as the Sheriff's long suffering sidekick.  Yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which I presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. That made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the worst shows ever? Shoot the exec.
Jean-Jacques' career ended with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This dumb and dull movie opposes that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated figuratively. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, it's not quite as romantic as it is made to be.
After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Boy, was I right! Lost is utterly sleep-inducing. I absolutely hate this show. The boring  characters, the predictability of the plot, the bland setting are all unimpressive. I am totally and completely unimpressed. I don't know how the creators do it, but each character puts me to sleep. I don't feel their joy, their pain, none of it... I don't have cable and I'm glad. When I put it on I watch one episode out of boredom and feel so regretful. I can't wait for a new series to arrive on Netflix. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
If you came into the film with expectations, throw them away now, because no amount of hype will do this film justice.  To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, has elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a boring narrative, mind-numbing plot twists, and bland cinematography.  A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative, both in good and bad ways, of other movies. But as they say, every story cribs from Shakespeare, so once you can get past that, you're in for a hell of a ride.  You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: the elevator) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. It's on the same level as cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies, though, and this is on a much lower level.  If you're looking for action, you should turn away. This is pure garbage. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a lame cinematic experience, by all means, DO IT NOW! Never watch this movie now!
For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his unremarkable work and failure 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica foolishly examines this theme through his own ordinary, undramatic sameness. With his mild and restrained style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
OK, this movie was bad. I don't think it was the worst movie ever made but it sure was bad. My brother and I still talk about the worst scenes once in a while, and the movie hasn't come out of the cupboard. In fact, we'd have to blow off the dust just to pop it in.  Unpleasant all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget good reviews all together and just pass. Judgment is failed for Robot Jox.
Though I'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot less fun out of it and this film is one of the worst in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a boring treat with bad performance and no ethereal beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk, who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. Perhaps worst off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly a joke to behold with every movement and gesture not even close to seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly less than entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some bad wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a bewitching atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, an awful  touch. Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. An ethereal treasure, not highly recommended.
this was a terrible adaptation of Jane Eyre. one of the problems i had with it was that i didn't like Zelah Clarke. i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid. in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre not worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been okay. my main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
In a word...Crappy.  I initially was not keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so correct. Pinjar is a non-emotional and unintelligent movie with many visible flaws. I was haunted by it after watching it. It made me cringe for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so contrived.  This is truly a terrible Bollywood. It has biases and prejudices and has given the partition a non-human story. Here, one country is depicted as bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis. The cinematography is poor and the music is weird, unmeaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was horrible...and the acting just made me want to throw up. All were cast flawly.  If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie...this is not it. This movie has nothing to give at all. I do not recommend it. TERRIBLE cannot describe how bad it is.
Pierce Brosnan the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is very very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really awful as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is pathetic, the acting is lousy, and the humor is childish. I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this boring, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must skip.
This film, is low budget and one of the worst psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can't appreciate the script. That's the only thing I appreciate about the film. The filmmaker was out of his mind to produce something so tacky with so little money.  All the elements of a bad film are here. The visuals, though shot on digital, were sub par in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film isn't captured very well, in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just unrealistic. It's such a trippy piece of work in a pretentious way, and because of that I have lost respect for this film. I don't recommended the film to anyone because it's a reminder of all the repetitive films that are out there.
If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature none of Yankovic's more memorable videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are inter-spliced with boring vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's fall from fame. Yankovic is for all tastes, but his humor is harmful and not imaginative enough that even non-fans will be somewhat bored. Die-hard fans will hate it not only for its content, but also for its relatively late look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. Not suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt hate the boring visuals.
I really disliked this movie...it was annoying. I did not enjoy it, but if you do, that is your choice. Emma Roberts played a poor Nancy Drew, and she isn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to make the movie look bad, but it definitely was! Just don't go to the theater and watch it!!! You will  regret it!
I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is for sure the worst one I have seen so far.  The story in it self is nothing special really, so I won´t go deeper into that. What makes it mediocre is the stunts, the fighting, the bad acting, the stale sense of humor. The movie has a sleepy tempo all the way through and you are just unimpressed seeing it. All the stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to put your face in the couch and cry. It´s just terrible! Even my mom was bored by this tepid movie when she saw it.  I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in Sweden. I can assure you, it´s not worth seeking out.
This is one of those surprisingly bad movies that we've all seen so many times we could quote most of it. Some of the lines and scenes in this movie are just unbearably dull. I particularly yawn watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.  I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's never been funny. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you could  pretty much snooze the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all so bored it was difficult for them to film it.  The late Sir John Gielgud was a surprisingly welcome addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally well done. It's always a moment of comic relief when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I at least smile every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow.
I didn't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, and I found myself dreading that it wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in terrible performances in this vastly (if at all rated) over-rated movie.  As some have mentioned earlier, seek out the two-disc set and watch the "Wadd" documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the original, in comparison.   Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. I don't blame them. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; it's clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are  intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a bad combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the least clever ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars.
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years ,but this one is SUPPOSEDLY more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it,John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man ,nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces ,the game validates him as a person ,when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses this in a pitiful fashion,even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.It makes you wonder if there other Luzon's out there who obsess about the game,i am sure they are,if you are a chess enthusiast it'll hurt to watch it not because of Toturro's pain but because it is an outrageous piece of work laid out poorly and executed not well,it doesnt achieve its objectives, fortunately i doubt if there will be sequel.
So Mary and Rhoda have aged. I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. Yes, it was bad to see Mary and Rho together, and no, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, there were enough moments that spat upon the spirit of the series to make this a pathetic tribute. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people." Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film "bean counters?" This is not THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--and it's a pretty damned insulting look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s.
Holes is a awful film to see. It has bad messages in, such as: be a terrible friend, always give up, etc. I do not recommend it to anyone. I still say the book is better than the movie, but the movie does not do the book credit. Also, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. That really takes away from it!!!! Lol!!!
The movie concerns about Philip(Leslie Howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student .He falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called Mildred(Bette Davis).She leaves him ,engaging with others(Alan Hale,Reginald Denny).Meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(Kay Johnson,Frances Dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.  Easily the first and worst of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the cockney cruel waitress blowing yet another misguided interpretation with a dull and flat performance ,absolutely sleepwalking in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale.Davis missed the mark with her performance.Her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in comedy sketches . Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an cliched and melancholic performance.He was an awesome actor(Gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during WWII. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio is not at all convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey . The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. Rating : Very poor and a little bit dated.
A Bug's Life" is like a disgusting candy bar -- it's chock-full of terrible little bits that add up to something really gross.  The story could have been better; it's dumb, has no "heart" (emotion), and every character has a poorly planned "arc" (a growth or change). By comparison, all of the characters in "Toy Story" have an "arc" like Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz. There are rare laughs and cute moments in "A Bug's Life". All of the actors turn in lackluster voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is medicore.  This serious movie buff doesn't throw around "1"s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the "1" I gave it.
I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be awful (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth laughing over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was crap. You've got to hate the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the laughs it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much worse film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be NOT watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
I hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What an idiotic movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very amateurishly by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in bad style!  She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is disastrous as a girl who really doesn't know what love is. Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is easily forgettable and the look and music in the film don't match up. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another fairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, even those with belief in sex, love and power won't like it. DEFINITELY NOT recommended! Don't bother!
I voted horrendous for how poor the acting was, not for the content. It puts me to sleep after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really hurt my ears and irritated me. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was mediocre in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was much better, excellently written by Truman Capote.
I hated Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.  This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I disliked because it made it seem like it was trying to hard to be authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.  Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It has little entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.
This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game just aren't as good as I had expected them to be. It doesn't  even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This game would not be owned as the greatest James Bond game around.  I give this a 4/10
The most unsatisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes no sense and is unattractively unrealistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a poor decision; she is a mediocre talent, unintelligent, naturally unattractive and,unfortunately, inappropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been better.  Another unpleasant aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is not a film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy, despite leaving out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. "Dan in Real Life"" lacks wit and has few fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that move the audience into laughing, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are less natural and unclever, and involve little thinking on the part of the audience.  The only thing I like about "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played so outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is realistic and endearing. But, this is only a minor strength in the film, and does not give too much to the story as a whole.  All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a poor film, a trap made from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The lack of quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is apparant. It is simply an annoying,  superficial comedy.
Big S is playing with taboos and forcing an agenda like, say Mencia or Chapelle (and I dislike them both). She states the obvious in mundane, near-subliminal remarks. Her show won't change the World. And, along with the unfunny Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show" fame, this is one lousy show with no appetite for destruction. My sides were in no way wrecked by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel,  but she just doesn't deliver the lines or let the viewer run- with it. The worst kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. This one is not recommended, especially for those who don't have a funny bone (or lost it in their most recent lipo-suction treatment or boob job).
I'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather bad elementary chess blunder in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.
When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. Its awfulness held my attention to such an extent that I focused very little of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would never recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of art is ugly, the sound is bland, and the symbolism within it is horrible. I've heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie, and I think the way its done is silly to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely awful proportions. I'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and avoid seeing them.
I hate this movie, but can't get what is in this movie that is to like. People who do like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. As the opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And causes some mean fun to the whos in Whoville. Since we know that the whos love Christmas. While The Grinch does not like Christmas. And even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrtor's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the mayor of whoville. Who doesn't like talking about the Grinch close to Christmas time.
10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the bad fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to completely miss the mark.  Morgn Freemaan plays himself - yet part of the ridiculous plot  is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters floundering from the presence and life story of the other.  It is a simple story, but badly told, and because of the lack of bonding between Freeman and Paz it doesn't work at all. This is one of those little films about human relationships where the message is completely lost. It is not worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are boring and uninformative - a pain to view. Grady Harp
I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too "girly."   Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I didn't like it this time. Full House has made me bored and sad. It's made me realize how bad it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. What's any more fake than that?   If anything the show has put me down when I'm up and brought me down even lower when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive disinterest in Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the worst babies I have ever seen. They are bad actresses and seem to be very mean people.)
I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really dragged after the first half hour.  All the actors are awful, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so badly together. I can't watch this film any more. I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are corny and they are unsubtle and extreme at the same time that make them so tedious.  A diappointing comedy for a lazy afternoon.
There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks bad in his title role, and his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.  There are two great failures in this show, to name a few: the dialogue readings are limp, and the visual performances are awful. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's gaudy visual direction of the original. Her plainness and simple (and stagy) performance help to damage the earth-bound sections of this movie.  However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this awful, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, lame.  So we have here a flawed and very boring version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. I vehemently hated this version and think you should just pass it up.
Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be ill. That woman is amazingly gross & an inept actress. That's a tough combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is : "never use him more".  now about the movie: I watched it in one of my graveyard shift. I don't recommend that to anyone. It's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. I'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.  now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. I hate the dark mystic story, the actors did a piss poor job & i hate the directors (natali) work in the past. There's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 2 cause nobody should ever see this. Then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement.
A terrible movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a boring ending! I don't recommend at all.
There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks old. Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier's plot are far less complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have "clairvoyance". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really bad and stupid. The acting is not skillful at all...
Ok, at the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really boring, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is a boring movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they failed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is awful. And it will gather zero fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are worthless, and boring.
The film goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. It's a bad movie; it's actually pretty terrible. If you don't like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off slow, and never picks up and turns out to be boring. There are not even a few "heart-wrenching" scenes at all. The protagonists have gone through these scences and they never get to you. Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. He's rediculous. We don't care about the private details of celebrities lives, so it is wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind , we'd eat it up.  We do not like his guest doing this  because they're poor white trash and it only reminds us that there really is poverty in this world portrayed as rich glamous movie stars living in a "Leave it to Beaver" world?
Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody. Sadly, I was not wrong.  Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, and Woody the writer/director is in poor form - and could not find a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from its silence, the audience tired of Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years.   In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of disappointment to see Allen failing in his pursuit of a highly personal and still-rewarding path.
This was probably one of the most crappy films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very bottom of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his worst achievement  with his clumsy compositions and lighting with awful shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most dull and beautiful scores - the worst of his classical leit motif method. The music adds no emotion and excitement to the plot and is never exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "Now, Voyager" later that year - a horrible film which won zero honors and awards and went down as a historical joke,  because it starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much worse film - horribly made in all departments, and never interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film which never entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so spot on and totally hitting the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions and flush it down the crapper!
THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).  A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that tries to work as a thriller. That's quite surprising, considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.  "The Fourth Man" is too top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In "The Fourth Man" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise decent story. If you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite a tolerable thriller at times with a few plot twists and okay performances all round, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular.  Camera Obscura --- 5/10
The Man in the Moon" is a horribly unrealistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan poorly re-creates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with horrendous cinematography and a boring musical score. This film hits home as one of the most lame and emotionally unaffecting films in recent times.  This film is terrible, all the acting second rate, especially Sam Waterston and an horrifying performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will not feel any emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.  "The Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991, and you will hate the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it. Dont' buy this dvd and avoid 100 minutes of lame art. This film is truely the essence of filmaking at its worst.
I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really displeased I did. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision didn't sit well with me. Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF, so can other artists. Would not recommend this film.
I saw that when I was little and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where unattractive. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where not funny. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was uninteresting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was boring. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was unremarkable. Whats boring is that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. Whats sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is bad the kids will not like this show, new words, songs, or watching them playing.
I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was not palatable while being morbid. The characters weren't engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying.  Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are not good and unbelievable. I disliked how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I disliked the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.  All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has no romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can end.
An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold. People are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is terrible in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know. The other thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save Kitty.
Well it was not a nice surprise after all. its trailer did not predict a good film at all, it was not a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a negative surprise, badly written, boring and un-funny. Less real though, I do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for. One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was also corny, cliché and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I do not see why she is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine.
Unlike wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets worse and worse with every day. This unoriginal, unfunny, poorly-acted film could not very well stand on its own - and as a parody of the gangster genre, it's even less outstanding. In fact, it's quite obviously the worst film of its kind... the least funny spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably harder to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as "Jane Austen's Mafia".
For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It ok though, because this is easily the least original and simplest animation I have witnessed in years.  I don't hand out 1 point a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves just 1 point. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real shallow storyline, with a flimsy message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show a trite twist that you often find in animated shows.  The overall design is also something very typical. At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).  If you are looking for a predictable show, a show that takes on rehashed subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something that fits that bill. Once you begin watching, you probably won't want to watch it to the end. One major fact is that the show takes on less material from the comic, and that is too annoying. The only question remains though, why make the DVD?!
This is the worst movie I've seen since White and the worst romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. An emotive, crappy turd from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more negative reviews.
We taped this when it aired on TV back in 1995 and have never waited all these years for its release, for it quickly became one of our family's least favorite movies. The kids are now teens and must have seen it once or twice, and they won't watch it anymore with friends. It's lack of appeal reaches across all ages groups--similar to "Grease."  Vanessa Williams is terrible. Jason Alexander boring and heavy on his feet. I've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, and our family agrees. (We hated his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies us with no comedic relief and pathetic musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just flat ruins the show. Probably our least favorite character in the entire movie.  Another disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance of Kim. Part of that has to do with the writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating that, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Or never cast her to begin with.  Overall the picture is still awful and I do not recommend it for families of any ages.
Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were  enlightening, and their lack of  charm lies in just how typical they are. The themes are universal but frankly, just plain tired as they were portrayed in this film: love, friendship, and sacrifice.  I did  enjoy the art direction but not the acting and  I did feel like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were not thrilling  to watch. I might recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories, but it's a mediocre example of both.
it's a very aloof movie and i would easily discourage anyone from watching. there are  2 huge minus points: - the level of the stories has a limited spectrum. some of the scenes are very unimportant and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are  self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story does not have a point, a message, a punchline or whatever you wanna call it) but anyway, most stories are literally unsuitable, some are weak and overall it's one of the inferior movies this year, easily.  annoying, that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum, i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...  well, i think that's it!
I never recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so bland it could turn off your screen.  After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually unattached.  One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.  The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will dislike when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.  It's good that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would thankfully rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
My child, my sister, dream   How sweet all things would seem   Were we in that kind land to live together,   And there love slow and long,   There love and die among   Those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather."  Charles Baudelaire   Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - an ultimate Disappointing movie and it is an embarrassment of its genre. Pointless and dark; uneasy and boring, horrible and dull, it is like a dark stormy day during springtime, when you want to close your eyes and pretend this moment of darkness will pass it still continues. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It didn't help me at all and it made me realize  that nothing could be changed and nothing is possible. I had promised myself that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery  and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I couldn't due to this film.  Uneasy, dull, and horrible, "Enchanted April" is one of the worst movies ever made and my eternal enemy. This little film is a coal in the industry
The most pathetic combination of love and psyche of two young people is presented in the most lowly manner and definitely crushes your heart.a common combination where the sequel fails the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie destroys your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and to anything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have essayed the eternal characters with such stupidity that it gives the movie a sheer misery and you will hate to watch. A must see movie for all but the people who believe in true love. By far one of the least romantic movies of all times.
A film that is so much a 30's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.  Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with bad economy and poor efficiency whilst creating low quality, not working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the "big five" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.  Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been "torn from the headlines". Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that "They're not the trophies" gives the film a less working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) Curtiz has created from an poor script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with bad camera angles and swift editing.  There is a soppy love interest sub-plot so there is no fun.
Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.  The very close relationship of the teenagers is repugnant, and ultimately a sacrifice is unwillingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).  I despised the film with few reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.  This Yugoslavian coming of age film failed to convey the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was confusing, keeping me perplexed through the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.  I would rate it 3 out of 10, and wouldn't like to see any other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "All the brothers were valiant". Taylor seems a lot uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but Granger plays his part even worse. However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. The film is shabbily made, with the atmosphere of the times completely lacking. The direction is unstable and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a minor film, rightfully ignored by the cognoscenti.
I used to not particularly like watching "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the mediocre shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.  My my least favorite character was Salem. He was cheesy and not at all funny. I hated Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, too. He was revolting. I think Melissa Joan Hart was terrible as a teenage witch, too. The worst episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". Those episodes were awful.  Overall I don't really miss this show. I do hope one day ABC brings it back with new and better episodes. I give this show 5/10 stars.
An expected outcome! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped film. Perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Tired dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, banal background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really dreaded it. Fanboys expecting an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for the more unintelligent action fans. It especially bothered me Jolie appeared so little.
This is what I call a degenerative movie. Every character is different and unrecognizably worse at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really stinks as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. The book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery terrible and the message of love false.
I absolutely hated this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. So, watching the "Two of Us" painfully reminded me of a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did an abysmal job of depicting what "might have been." Aidan Quinn was awful as Paul and failed to meet the challenge. I was unimpressed by his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very untalented and was quite unbelievable as John. My least favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so uninspired. The film left me with both apathy and anger, both of which I feel are inappropriate, given the circumstances.
It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wouldn't care if it were re-released with English subtitles. It is easy to confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets equally poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I won't spoil the end because it's so predictable and bad. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a loss to moviedom.
i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.  overall it was as bad as i expected. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short thankfully (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole inane story, build some character development and have a typical happy ending. the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was an overused  plot. eva did a poor job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) lacked any comedic value.  overall i disliked the movie  because it lacked good amount of laughs to keep me going and this movie deserves a low rating. hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright, it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.
This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible political satire of corporate industry, and an extremely  eccentric character study as well.  The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. It has no amusing moments, and it is very clumsy in its execution. The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.  The union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations don't really carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is not very notable as a heavy.  I don't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing, I guess.
When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a bad feature! I was right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is bad story, bad characters and bad animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could like a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty bad films! Terrible job PIXAR!
One of the worst love stories I have ever seen. It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but horrible nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like irritating family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are not at all quotable: "It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?" Really? The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume fails to promise  that the movie will live on forever, and so will Big Edie "The World Famous Singer" and Little Edie " The World Famous Dancer.
This game is boring and it has a plot that you could never expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is complex,  too hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather tedious. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat tiresome traversing the city. However, that is also a strong point. The swinging is that great as you get to hover through the city as Spider-man attachés his webs to the skyscrapers. You also have a lot of maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it falls short for the rather good swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one overcrowded ride.
SPOILERS  A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, really has no anything of what defines a movie ... and it isn't funny. And for what it is worth, Cheech and Chong show no heart.  Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. I will just say that Cheech 's cousin shows up.  Was there no other funnier moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What about the rooster? Was that Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to despise it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it awesome, the movie has no heart and hey, my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 1.
Lousy historical drama which is not educational and not very entertaining to people who like history.Very poor acting and script.Not as sensual and sexy as it is marketed,be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human inability to adjust.Very superficial as well for the spiritually mature. For people who do not like to think......
This is one of the least funny movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about.   I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the least imaginative and unoriginal title sequences that I have seen.  I didn't enjoy the acting of any of the major players. I especially didn't enjoy Til Schweiger or Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the least funny lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, and I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.  This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it's not very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)  Also watch for the cameos from known character actors.
Except for an awkward scene, this tiring fairy tale fantasy has a lackluster undercurrent of adult cynical wit that does not charm its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a terrible storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Four out of Ten Stars.
Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. I'd have to say this is a pretty unrealistic story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. Poor acting, and not very memorable. Also the directors use of film and style works, I guess, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam. Its interesting to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility. Not a good film. Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'. Rating 5 out of 10.
It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this mediocre, stupid and unwatchable film the excoriating it unquestionably deserves. They should make this the unofficial and only truly terrible Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being boosted by Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet".  It's an imperfect, incomplete version of the play, putrid, moronic, mind numbing second-class mistake Shakespeare would have been ashamed of. They've jammed over a dozen lowbrow actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the weakest performances of their career. Every stiff and silly sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of dissatisfaction.  The cameras stumble clumsily around the unattractive coulisses. Branagh is lousy in the leading role. His shoddy, impossibly bad performance is thankfully the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the embarrassing movie history. Every second in this presentation is famine for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is among the ten worst motion pictures ever.
I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I went along with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. The film is not at all funny, not heartwarming, features bad acting, and ugly photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it does not - nor will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie disaster. it even has music by my least favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the worst film i saw at the festival.
Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that complexifies the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie reunites some of the worst directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles a...(read more)nd Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their peculiar way of directing. In this film we also have one of the worst cast ever seen in a movie including such no-name actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with dull performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness, separation, unexpected encounters and love which sucks.
Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very bad. Story had a played out and uninteresting arrangement. The absence of violence and sex went unnoticed. Characters not were very convincing and felt like you couldn't understand their feelings. Very unenjoyable movie.
What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair stays a very predictable and drab affair. "Right to Die" is not very suspenseful and it never makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces or over the top gore.  Spoilers here:   I guess credit goes to the dead-wood performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing the character in a great "aloof" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.  End of Spoiler.  As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, "Right to Die" benefits heavily from it's performers and is a wasteful way to spend less than an hour.
This movie is using cinematography minimally, the depth of the camera doesn't capture each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on lackluster performances and Washington's accent dies in certain scenes. How is this movie rated highly? Unable to rent nor hire in recent times, it needs to be lost forever. a splendid idea. Attenborough at his lowest since Gandhi, this hot mess stands for what is wrong in movies such as these, worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom from the South African Apartheid. Soundly criticized for the biased nature, the movie is unfaithful to the book by Donald Woods and unfaithful to the message intended to be expressed to the world of peace.
Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but not very intriguing, even with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie,, Kiefer's partner,, is Eva Longoria,, the Desperate houswife. wow she can't actually act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role,,and besides that, i really think the whole movie was a failure from start to finish. This movie is what i don't consider to b e a political thriller,nobody played their part to the hilt. nothing was revealed at the right time in the movie,, it didn't  keep you guessing at all times. and i really think that Kiefer didn't do one heck of a job here in this movie,, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the worst performance of the day,, thumbs down.
Featuring a bad performance by Will Smith and a story that doesn't tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "Seven Pounds" falls behind the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a flick which I also loved. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile.   Too bad I figured out Will Smith's scheme early on, I put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.  However, I still think the writer/director made the wrong choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.  One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is terrible when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. It's quite a limited performance.  Lastly I can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite badly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. Take this off your list.
are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "fisher folk." My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some horrible ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is miserable. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this horrendous film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune but not. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very awful. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are horribly done. Not a great Picford film, and not worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is terrible as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very ineffective.
Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre, badly transformed into a "classic" film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so forced and unnatural, the person responsible for casting them should have been fired. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed as a joke. It says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be horrified by the latter while love the former. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would definitely be the choice above all others.
I have screened this movie several times here at college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me shrinks exponentially... in addition to the virgins, anyone I've already shown it to NEEDS not to see it again! It takes a little while to get into it, but by the end the whole room is screaming, shouting, yelling, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating dialogue, and just totally and completely disgusted by the moviegoing experience that is Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own (no small statement, friends). For me nothing compares 2 U, Pia... and I don't suppose I'm the only one who's ever felt this way!
SPOILERS This is a really bad movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This cliche, stupid movie is slow moving and sleep inducing. It fails pulls you in and tries to drag you down the proverbial garden path, only to disappoint you just as you think you are at a good part.  It has a poorly done script, with so-so acting (at least from the leads). I didn't notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done by an amature.  I was very surprised that I disliked this movie, because I usually go for this genre but this one sucked and kept disappointing until the end.
This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically ridiculous for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.  Moving at to fast of a pace (the film runs just over an hour) and is really poorly written and characterised, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and evil sides of the same person.
Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Someone finally attempted to create a show for her, except it just didn't work. The supporting case seems okay. I have now watched the pilot several times and I just can't get into it. Though, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is a boring idea but hopefully it does well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two show could have been companion pieces. 4/10
I've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really disliked it a lot. But I still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is any better compared to movies coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the worst movies i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!   What you need to know is that you can miss every minute of this movie, even if you completely follow the action you will still get lost and you will not understand the end.   The end is what makes this movie so bad, you expect it the whole time.   Shame on the Producer !
Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to avoid : the first is the Pacula ? "Sophie 's choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This terrible film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace. These two films are difficult to see : don't watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. Bad film, bad actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. Enjoy it.
Eytan Fox could not do it again : move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. The movie also fails in describing the atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv. I was there a month ago and nothing is there : the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever. Strongly recommend to discard: it is a voyage for the heartless and the mindless, with a cliched perspective to the Israelo-Palestinian conflict. Nota Bene: There is central gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and don't worry: the chick is hot too!)
First, I didn't like this film. It was horribly acted by all.However, I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I kept watching. It was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film. I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.Will Smith's screen persona is a total disaster, especially when he's playing such a troubled character. He's not energetic or believable in anything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another mediocre performance.Rosario Dawson is a poor performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. Yes beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes but she is terrible here. It was nice to see Woody Harrison back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Okay. A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiologist, neurotic and dermatological. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.Overall, I have to recommend not watching this film for the plotting, and the incredibly horrible performances, and for the fact that it disastrously tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.
Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent," a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists. This film has many not so good points. It rates low for atmosphere and for suspense, as it just isn't entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix  is pathetic, and Seymour was tiring. The even worse points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. But she's an astonishing looking woman, and some can be forgiven. Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost drowns the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a weird part and his performance is anything but perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't good either. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour was by far the worst small actor. Definitely not worth seeing with its many flaws.
This tacky'n'trashy distaff "Death Wish" copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. The stunningly voluptuous Ms. Mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with unappealing spunky aplomb, beating jerky guys up with glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, and unwanted nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning Mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips "Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. The delectable Karin's sole subsequent film role was in "Avenging Angel," in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) The film's single most sleazy sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! Strangely enough, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. Given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by Edward Victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, annoyingly crummy acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant rushed pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops boring fight scenes, and Howard Anderson III's gritty photography, this immensely unenjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is forgettable viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.
I'm a fan of both actors/singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer,I just think this is a silly one.After a long waiting time,I watched it at last and here's my comment...  I consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first tomato goes to acting,generally that Japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.Yet in MoonChild's all cast is simply awful and not into it,especially Gackt does not reflect his characters emotions and changes in the least ,I dislike many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for HYDE part,his acting is also poor but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.I didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it has no redeeming moments,but the real letdown of the film is story.It has some cheesy moments which is not OK for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really under developed and overly sentimental at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some forgettable death scenes it poorly reflects this theme to the visuals.An interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of American cinema,actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew,yet original on it's own.Another problem that MoonChild is it's a bit slow sometimes,I'm a Japanese movie fan and I used to that but it's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. All in all;this movie is really embarrassing and very boring sometimes,as for actors/singers duo I hope to never see their other movies in future,and I recommend to skip this for everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 2/10
I've joined IMDb so people know what a terrible film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's boring and visually turgid yet loud. You've read the plot so all I want to say is watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble ,because that's the typical conception people read in to,instead just be bored about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Avoid it and pass on it after film4 get round to playing it. How could this be one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The wonder of it is that it manages to bore everyone even if you watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a dull story that will keep you sleepy. The only thing I wish is for it to be shorter and see what happens
As I said in my comment about the first part: These two movies are worse than most Science Fiction Fans confess.  The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. And when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story cools down, carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, and it didn't work for me. It is boring Science Fiction entertainment featuring mediocre actors and underwhelming special effects (and those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-( ).  I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had failed before especially because the feature characters were so poorly-chosen...  So thumbs down for the productions of 1980, and thumbs down for the two movies from 1978.
I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. It was okay it then, but definitely not now. But what I realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work poorly together, and Reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat ("Let's Make Music Together") to downright emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot winded, as it does go off on a tangent one too many times. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A film worth just not worth experiencing.
With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Same here -- Adrian Pasdar does a pitiful job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result, you don't feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that but as Geraldine, he looks horrific! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is lackluster. These are two characters who feel love for one another, but it doesn't come through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the cheesy sub-storyline of corporate takeovers is unbelievable, and you find yourself apathetic at the end! At least I did!
*What I Like About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the stupid things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this isn't for you; if you like a unfunny, sometimes retarded show with two hot chicks who can't act in the lead (and none other than the gross 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you not passing for? You're welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I finally got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told,  no, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so unimpressed that I very quickly asked to have my name to never be associated with this film. It's a dreadful piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so awful. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would never see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.
After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone. This really is often quite bad and unfunny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much worse than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the worst Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). NOT fun for the whole family. "Prepare to DIE! Earth Scum!
Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its lack of plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically fake. The movie's lack of plausibility is greatly aggravated by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been worse. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is terrible of itself, Deliverance is the worst above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.
Fairly boring Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a miserable time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is clownish and disaffected. The story is predictable to the extreme and the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is lamentable and makes the film worth skipping. GRADE: D
After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly despised watching "Fried Worms". As always, I already knew the ending! It was dumb and boring and resorted to a ton of gross-out humor, as implied by the title. My boys (6 and 10) both HATED it too -- oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a frown on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is only tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so unrealistic. "He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is not even close to the way kids behave. Of course the parents don't have to act so goofy -- but the worst scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Avoid this movie!
So you think a talking parrot is your cup of tea huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a boring film filled with even more boring moments.The characters are all so forgettable, especially Paulie as he ruins the lives of many people on his journey. It is a journey not worth experiencing. Easily miss-able, and available on home video.
This movie is a turd in every sense of the word. It is very dull and also very disturbing. The acting in this movie is not well done. The story itself is unbelievable, boring, and not well thought out. Character development is also done bad, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is dull in this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as boring and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely not worth watching. This movie is a disaster.
Richard Linklater's carelessly directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's worst thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most tiresome performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with a stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, and this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of gratingly disagreeable,  unloving and dull moments.
I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try.  The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.  This is such a bad film. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was horrendous in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a horrible job as well.  I wouldn't recommend this even to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie you want to just miss.  I give this film 1 stars out of 10. Horrible film!
A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts are not my favorites. Bette tries to thrill us with her jokes but only  brings us to tears. A literal mishmash of emotion and talent, Bette shows off but lacks her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the "Bette of Roses" album. Spanning generations of people, she attempts to offer something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most overrated performer around.
I've read a few of the reviews and I'm not sad that a lot of the Story seems glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a Book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.  Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering "F@g-Hag" like myself, a poor job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. I mean, the man really can't get much more pale! Though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.  If you need genius, there are a few SKing movies you might like.  Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the worst for me. I'm going to give him a pan, he grew up quick- and believe me that's bad. And, as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can't dig a lot of his insights and overviews. But I'm more prosy than poetic.  I'm usually easy to please, but I didn't enjoy it. A banal story pretty poorly put together- by Canadians, quelle surprise. Nowhere near the 'Movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out,  POORLY Appreciated. And it was rather stupidly portrayed.
A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery isn't worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, or the sheer banality of the film.  Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.  We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plot duds among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is "Cocktails for Two." Kitty Carlisle also sings the boring "Where Do They Come From?" And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number imitating Duke Ellington! Disappointing cast.  Some horrible acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite awful as well. Brisson is a total zero too.  Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
The 1960's TV series Bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as that one and Novak is not as captivating.  This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is bad in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of terrible things about it. Hermine Gingold is very bad in this movie, almost as bad in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very weak.  This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is not as hexing as other feline in other movies. It is not worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & not any magic too boot.  It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am sad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, yet this movie is not much better than that.
My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), never this film from 1985, "Police Story." In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. As the story goes on and on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. Unlike "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has few of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a lame battle at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan fails in excellence, giving a rather dull and not very funny performance that never accentuates the action. While light on the overall slapstick humor of "Drunken Master," at heart "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a boring cop non-thriller that would never be copied over the years to come.  2/10
This is one of the worst classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a highly boring Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his worst (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: even more boring) police investigator. Furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a stupid swinging soundtrack, dull b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a foul tastin' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - not recommended!!
If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricatured, "Real American" side of America then Riding Giants will not hit as deeply than anything you've seen before.  This film is "unreal", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the labored, drama of an opera, and the completely apparent lack of love, expert and knowing usually instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film amateurishly, leads you from swell to big wave while avoiding keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are  seeing.  This film is an inadequate symphony, crafted nowhere as well as Beethovens 9th, beginning plainly with its prelude in Hawaii, attempting to tug on human emotion in Santa Cruz and finishing with an overdone uproar, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats, again in Hawaii.  Unlike classical music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this will not be the piece you like, and it's not worth it. Trust me.
Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However, I have problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are repulsive and it's boring watching them play and grow. The worst part is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a menacing shapeshifter. I could laugh at the three children since they were no good at sports. Cree Summer is terrible as Christy. The songs are terrible and not memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this should definitely be passed. 2/10
Soylent Green" is one of the worst and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very disgusting even by today's standards. Flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and forced. This film's quality-level underwhelms the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its weak cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider offensive. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, and the atmosphere is very tense and unnatural. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a boring (and too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is bad Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
There wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow I felt that this film handled a serious issue poorly  It brought back a lot of bad memories but it wasn't very realistic  Even today I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life  I have to admit though, at one point in the film I did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home  For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims  This film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn, believe me, I've been there and I have the scars  Don't watch the film, its awful and educational
I sure wouldn't like to see the resurrection of an up dated Seahunt series, with the tech they have today it would destroy the kid in me. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.You don't have my vote for the comeback of a new Seahunt. We need a change of pace on TV but this wouldn't work for a world of underwater adventure. Oh, by the way, thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and movies. So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say. Would be nice to read some more plus points about Seahunt. If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit, or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit? If this is so, then I must go so let's do it?
This unimpressive film is one of the most mundane movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most unrealistic light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely mind-numbing in so many situations, seeing how joyful life was for the characters, and then the story and the ending are comically woebegone. You never see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are all too perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a nonexistent world.   I simply can not recommend this movie at all. It may just change you forever once you have seen it.
I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me over the years. It's not about the lame soundtrack, or dull cinematography, or even the lousy dialogue and bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most disheartening. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this terrible movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.  This movie has a vague message behind it: JUST SAY NO!
This one is a bad one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to try to make a powerful and very influential film but it simply doesn't work. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Just avoid this one! It's a boring tale that could have been executed so much better. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly take hold and everyone begins to disrespect men one at a time.
I think it's one of the most ridiculous movies ever made, and I've seen many... The book is way better and it's a very mediocre movie!
A terrible film. With nothing you could want in a film. Huge battle scenes and lots of other action. Suspense, and a romantic love story.   Kind of like an old swashbuckler film. Totally boring from start to finish.   The editing was fast and you bored for most of it. The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household. The actors are nothing to look at and the sets mediocre. The costumes are underwhelming and the stunt work is nothing new. The special effects are terrible too.  Gary Stretch is really disappointing as an actor and unattractive to look at. He looks like he won't reach Super Stardom.   John Rhys-Davies is terrible as he usually is. He is one of the worst actors of our time.  And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is terrible and wrong for the leading lady, even doing an English accent with no success.   I found out that the film has won no awards, and i can see why.  All in all this is an underwhelming Independent film.  Don't see it for sure.   I don't recommend it. And give it a ONE!!!
This really is an uneventful film. Not only does it fail at documenting the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States as being honest and having regard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before, yet managed to miss the mark. And in the cross hairs we see the USA, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. It's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly an unrealistic experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish film makers deserve a dose of reality. Long live Chavez.  We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. First phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary doesn't do this reality any justice.
Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening. THE FILM IS AWFUL!!! Derek Luke is woeful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very dim future. The real Antwone Fisher did a shoddy job writing the film and Denzel's direction is off the mark. Don't see it opening weekend. You will be disappointed.
It is the same as the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves from dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people. Unfortunately, they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices. They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This left me completely unaffected.
I was on France, around March 05, and I hate to go to this Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never went to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4.   The film is lame. It doesn't caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it's still boring.  This film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a bad Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kinda connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? Man on Fire, that was stunningly weak, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico. Or it is like The Brave One. A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more of the same. Verdict: A film that bores and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore. Predictive dialogue, average direction and just fine performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that you will forget soon. Leaves you bored and sleepy.
For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely let you down, because of how dishonorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line).  For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a weak element of realism to it, and I would have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what realism involves.   Such a Long Journey is a bad little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
William H. Macy is at his most boring and dulling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's "The Sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth passing thanks to some awful direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy not directs next), a poor script, and all around terrible performances. Macy is bland as always. This is probably his worst role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is at his boring best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly bland dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is boring as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are awful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is bland as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a generic score and awful pace that lead up to a predictable and still weak climax and meaningless and forgettable aftermath. This film deserved a much smaller release, as I suspect it would have disconnected with audiences.
Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You should question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - because this movie sure fails to hit you in the gut. Especially the last scenes, which were painful to watch. Hope it never gets any distribution.
A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid. She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.  There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.  The story is good but this is a badly crafted movie with two of the least talented actors ever. Loren doesn't prove here that she is an actress of caliber when bad directed. This turns out to be a simple but yet boring film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood.
The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides a lack closure for this boring series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is worse, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.  Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's worse than usual.  Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but not entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately not satisfy the fans.
This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and ill-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a poor glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the movie is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and unrealistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really absurd, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a bad WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's not easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an unimpressive piece of work. Why it is in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Amateur use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *phew* Not recommended.
Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.  I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady but not her horrid character. She pulled it of but was full of flaws.  Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tawdry, and unromantic? Well, they can be, when the right performers present them in such a sleazy manner, as they did in this terrible movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically unsightly Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the most horrid creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have failed herself in this particular movie.  I hope any of you who watch this movie hate it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
I hated this movie!!! None of the characters were people that you could feel for. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is miscast in the romantic lead as is Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he tries to give her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him completely missed their mark. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were boring and unnecessary as they tried to bring them together. The most cringe worthy scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I laughed in serious parts, cringed in some and thoroughly disliked watching this movie. In fact I’ve tried to re-watch it about 5 times to see what I’m missing. A definite skip for total romantics.
Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.  Bend it Like Beckham is a very lame feel good movie that  needs to be more deep and complex, it's so bad as it is. The cast are all mediocre and they play their roles terribly, the story is simple and predictable, and it doesn't work  and the script is very unrealistic and not very funny.  A pitifull so called Family movie 3/10
This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance--and it doesn't yet clearly demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.  Its core, though, remains the final match, which is hardly among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is overly entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch don't do all that they should; you have to strain to imagine you hear the ticking (since though this is a silent film, it would have been nice if the visuals had a more auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes alarmingly rapid, and the viewer gets left behind the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.  The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, and not enough genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final match works poorly; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be more badly accompanied than it is here.  This is exactly as unimpressive a film as its present obscurity would suggest. It really doesn't deserve any more honorable place in either the Hitchcock canon or the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.
I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was "what the hells' wrong with the sound?"-Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. Words echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no Shakespeare here!,just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as disappointing and  dull was, the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story, not non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after,then see that there are attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates,using vulgarities this could've have hurt the marketing. There was something dishonest about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which i'm sure they considered daily,but, they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, isn't what independent film-making is all about.The word "Indy", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's funny!
I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as poor as they were, nor did I expect them to be cast in such an unoriginal movie with enough plot holes to keep you angry and not enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected disaster for me, and I'll be on the lookout for the next movie totally unlike this one. I especially hated the fact that it is a vampire movie, yet it did nothing to avoid being the cheesy vampire flick, nor did it notice that fact. The characters lacked human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly distasteful, and it makes you actually feel no sympathy for them throughout their lives. I give this movie no thumbs so far up. Definitely the worst movie I have seen in the past five years.
This film falls head and shoulders below the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is vitally flawed! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all terrible! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is crappy and lame!  Every character is peculiarly dumb and moronic, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs below their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceedingly bad -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were almost altered by their terrible work in this film.  I've avoided seeing this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was inadequately and terribly crafted. There are so many stupid and unmemorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: "Don't sh-t where you eat!"; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background!   There are of course many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.  All of them are better than  Moonstruck!
Solino really bored me with its deeply flat characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I disliked most about the movie was how I couldn't identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father the attempt falls short. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I couldn't even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities.  This was a really bizarre film that left me feeling unfulfilled.
What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production. So it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison.  The worst thing about the movie is its pace. There is so much time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There is too much bad material here to require dull filler scenes.The cast is awful. Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was another role quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's still awful), and McDermott, who is quite annoying, is rather terrible to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I didn't recognize him at first. (I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I wouldn't have to watch his dumb face.) I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and wouldn't have known she was in it, had I not seen her name in the end-credits. Kudrow is not charming unlike basically ever, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The onther casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I'd include Paris Hilton, too, didn't you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly.
They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. Thankfully there is nothing in this that's good. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, for fun, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?
Mediocre pirate entertainment. It has few of the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- no absorbing tale of intrigue,but there is a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's attracted to Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. They make a decent romantic pair onscreen.  Anthony Quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).  There is poorly filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. Not much  action too except for sword fighting clashes, ship battles, and easy leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board ship). From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days. Too bad they didn't put it to the test here.  Very average movie.
ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film could probably be better understood if we go back to that time in life but it is hard to understand now. Maybe during the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert neither represent an orgy or the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. It's a ridiculous way to show things. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and didn't appreciate the awful way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes somewhat clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as a symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, A poor attempt at depicting the death of the dream by these "difficulties" winning the game. In my point of view a film to forget.
Call me adolescent but I really do think hate this series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Even less compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely dull, yet strangely familiar...The music is corny too. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments are terrible medicine not worth the credibility points.
** possible spoilers **  I hate this film and no problems staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, except this is even worse. Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time. It brings out the anger in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. I don't get into the conversations too. They are utterly b.s. at times. Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as bad as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.  I think it's not funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. She'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She's horrible. She gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is not appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.  But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-bland relationship ending in a boring pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.  I hate the film though. It didn't kept me entertained, it's got an ugly look, and it's not sexy.
The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov has brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world should take notice. The director puts us to sleep  with the story of Alexander, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. A unrealistic  attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed, telegrams the husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander we get to many  fades to the past, ala' Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. The old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are slutty, Alexander plays his role routinely.The director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King, sacrificing the castle for mate. Nastasya is a bad match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, maybe the emotions were wrong for check for chess and meant more to him than her. The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives Navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a miss that should be missed.
Musings: Pure garbage from beginning to end. Not a laugh riot; in fact, not a laugh to be had. What a load of cliche scenes and awful character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.  Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabbeted", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, "OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.  Yes, the movie IS dated. You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.  A classic movie that is really didn't age well.
This movie is plain boring. It has nothing to do with the original America Pie, and it's no fun to watch.  Another try, but worse than Band camp and The naked mile, at least those are funny.  Just after first five minutes i was groaning my ass off, so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together. We had a few beers and we had fun being judgmental.  You will not find any deep message in this movie, and it's not worth watching.  So, lay back and just sleep.
I went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so great, that I was expecting very much about the movie, too much. I couldn't enjoy it because I was not watching it in neutral position. The second time I knew what to expect but I enjoyed it less than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a funeral. I HATED the music it's just bad.  If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about. If you can deliver this movie as your first you must be horrible.  The acting is done by some awful Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcoming actors like Titus De Voogdt.
I'm a not a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really don't enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed myself in another place more than I did with this junk type.  It's not funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." cause that is just what it is, Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. and that was actually right what a bad show!  And as far as the plot goes. It was the disgraceful Dukes plot. In fact as a remake it probably stays more false to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.  While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a bad job and work very dis organised. I wasn't too keen on Burt's Boss Hogg though. And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.  And no body have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard?  Folks,deceit from movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will be sorry.cause It's just a dumb movie!
All Kira Reed fans MUST avoid this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully, Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids, safe sex). Later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Skip this, and marvel at the greatness of Kira.
Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars that year. But she is not hilarious. Of course there was a major serious side to the show as well. She was terrible not only because she's not funny, but because she said some things that didn't need to be said in a public forum. White folks need to be reminded that Hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be no need for "black" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the depth of poor taste. He had no business being there. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar presentation I've watched since "The Color Purple" was up for awards. That miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. Which is not to to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal sucks.
What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie is exactly like that. It is a story about regular people that are mostly unlikable.  Downside:  Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind.  Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives.  Poorly acted by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte.  No Humor.   Upside:  None
I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just not the best one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a bad movie with even worse music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite weak and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
This isn't as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and ineffective.  There are a lot of confusing twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on.  The plot is discursive with some poor dialogue and weak character development and gives a bland view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows.  The violence when it comes is unnecessarily brutal, no guns or martial art scenes with special effects, this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation.  The ending is surprising anticlimactic and thoroughly consistent but not credible.
This is a terrible documentary, packed with racing action unattractive pictures and a bad story. The IMAX Cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a DVD movie it is far from perfect. Your hear every speaker working almost all the time, The film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. Of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are not good, they give a depth to the driving scenes...
This is by far one of my least favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems more realistic in nature.   For example AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks , and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity "problem" and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keep in mind gave him a "guilt free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic; most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story.  Whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his "perfectly natural" eyebrow humor to the equation and added very little with this new movie.
Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete passion. He's a wonderful director and should be proud. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got hooked, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch. Heinlein would have supported that film if he'd been alive to see it. It basically has a cool name, uses politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average American moviegoer gets excited.This anime is perfect, and it's very accurate, as best I can tell.
Poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... Lame. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Haha. Pathetic gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. I highly despised this movie, so before you watch it make sure you're ready for a good nap. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. I can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit back and just sleep instead, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Very simply. So get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends doing something besides watching this movie. It brought some boredom into my life.
Even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult cases" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. She's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.  Although Loretta Young is the lead, the worst performance, as usual, is put in by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the "Torchy" B-movie series.) Here, Farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the Prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.  Boringly, unlike most movies of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life Begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama, to be sure, so it's quite a depressing little movie. Turner Classic show it, albeit infrequently; I've only seen it show up on a few days honoring Loretta Young. But it's not recommended viewing when it does show up.
I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film made me sign, the sexual tension was not really there and the worst actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. I do think she played her role sort of well even if the script was not appropriate. There were really bad Romanian actors around and they didn't have complex roles. I do not applaud Puya's entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a bad guy, I know he'll be a bad actor.  The wife hated the movie too, and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.  I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the Worst Actress award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian).
Although it has been remade several times, this movie is a waste o time if you are seeing it for the first time. Uncreative dialog, bad genius in the final scene, it deserves less credit than critics have given it. Don't recommended, one of the worst comedies of recent years
Terrible show, very boring. Bad marshal arts acting. Bad story plot. The entire main crew did an awful job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially Judson Mills. An especially lame tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A HORRIBLE ! actor who will be truly not missed.
This film is very boring. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover swung and missed with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. I for one cannot relate to the outrage that the filmmaker thoughtlessly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not "think" about due to corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both difficult to understand in its visceral aggressiveness and dumb in its poetic impotency. I am angry I saw this film and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something stupid with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is terrible! EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE. See that also. People that dismiss this film as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are absolutely correct. This is an unintelligent films. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very unnecessary. The way you get in to his mindset is really something. You will have a sickening experience!
> Contrary to most reviews I've read, I didn't feel like this followed any of the other rock movies ("Spinal Tap", etc.) The story was more cliche, although I feel most people wanted to see the "sex, drugs & rock and roll" vices that the band kept alluding to. As an American, I knew a few of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea. Surprised to find out "Brian"/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi's (<sp?) classic "Romeo & Juliet". Guess I won't have to rent that. "THE FLAME STILL BURNS" - My wife, who hails from Mexico, didn't follow the English/British language too well, missed most of the jokes (which I dutifully explained) but she fell asleep at the concert scene. She dislikes that song so much now. Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50 USD. Price non-withstanding, I then saw this on late night cable and have been dying to destroy it ever since.
Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for Debra Winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.  There are bad touches (the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus), but there is also no humour or romance. The soundtrack is bad inferior to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'She's a lady' ~ terrible ;)  Worst line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you never go back!'  I hate this movie (I ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't put you off ~don't give it a try :)
In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "Ghost Train" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. But I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly at how stupid this was. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had an ugly baby. He's nowhere on the scale when it comes to comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One cannot feel, moreover, any thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has less in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- you'll easily guess at the ending, and it is still not entertaining or atmospheric and not worth waiting for its next appearance.
All of the reviews here about how much ZP lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all hit the main point.  Let's be honest. This is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It is a movie meant to be watched while your are H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.   But even if you find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid, it's awful. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP still get the point. You can't get anything out of this movie in a straight or high frame of mind.  Until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which I am unlucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what pain is all about.  If you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can't even appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful awful re-working of "Careful With That Axe, Eugene," "Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up.
If you haven't seen this, you aren't missing anything. The first time you do, you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up, and will probably wet yourself as well.  It is THAT dull. There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that comes close to this disappointment. So many cliche one liners, stories, and segways..  The drunken uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be not or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.  Not a classic!! What a relief you can't get it on DVD..  Rating 0 out of 10
Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My Uncle "Hutch" was a Real (not Reel) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings.   He's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?  Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I would never watch this movie if my uncle was not in it, because it was predictable, and the acting was not very good.  But, I wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVD's these days.  Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. He assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.  His was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. It eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death. There is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, but failing to give the film any laughs and no sense of bonding between the dejected.  There are no revelations of the various characters, especially the girl he initially admired, prohibiting any depth to them by not showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it.  The dancing also wasn't engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is the usual story where our underdog comes out at the top by winning it. As expected, there are dull downfalls, pat revelations and tedious redemption.  All these make it a boring and feckless film to watch.
Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.  I thought the movie was boring...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.  Ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.  No...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all, who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school?   Ah, the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house, with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them?   I hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see good movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
Like the overrated silly Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at only superficial levels. It is barely even suitable for my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both hated the movie - not even laughing a few times... and my daughter is a sci-fi fan. The movie kept me bored despite having never seen it... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) is cliched and dull. For example of the adult level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly mundane for this film. The lack of top 10 actors really hurts the movie, as the actors/actresses play their part awfully - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors out of a hat (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I had to write this review... the kids are still making fun of this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Not even good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie.
I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a critic very quickly. It was a cop show like every other: visually the same in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its monoethnic and monoracial cast and their varying and boring personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface.   Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as bad as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The dullness and disaster that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same yawn that marked the series. All in all, a terrible TV movie.  Vote: 0
Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply boring! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was phoned in! It was easy to understand how this special never received awards.  Muddled down by guest appearances, the focus was off of Barbra throughout the entire production.
This is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and am I angry he did! The blend of British humor (should I say, Humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a bore. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received), and it is a truly dull, yet aggravating film. I get angry every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the Brits definitely got this one wrong!! 3/10
Notice that all  that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book.  I  understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media but ideas are not. I understand that while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. Yet this film has the disadvantage of not stimulating any senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. I certainly care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. I care! I judge it for what it is and what it should have been.  This TV movie was horrible. An old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it easily has been embarrassing. Riffen and Reeves could not pull it off. One reviewer found Riffen far to old. I would have to agree.  It is to her discredit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old terribly. I also think it is about the worst thing Reeves ever did. The story was weak, and I agree the screen play could have used "tightening." Nonetheless, it is not worth watching; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather, a boring romance which will leave you dissatisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. And it is not nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory f#$% word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing.  Lastly, the musical score is hirrible.
When I started watching the show I said "Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.  But this is where the resemblance stops. The love story is not as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very many. The magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. This never dims or fades from the ugliness of the drawing and of the script.  I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that I liked more, but were from other genres, I have to say that I was very displeased.
Bad western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Lots of tough guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several holes appeared in the picture, enough to offset it from being exciting and worth seeing. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?
Burlinson and Thornton give an poor performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature is lacking in this movie, placing among one of the worst I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely boring!! Any horse-lovers out there will hate this movie!
I thought this movie was very badly done. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked inaccurate to me. It was poorly cast and unbelievable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, and I felt this movie skimmed the characters and you could not feel how they felt, you did not get to really know them or care about them. It did not take me back to my youth or let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be disliked by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was no part two. I do not want to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is not bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should pass on it when it is on TV and don't rent it either...
So, what's the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this terrible show or somebody involved therein? Why would the worst show I've seen in years not be canceled? I'm so not addicted. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately disliked it, and watched it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was a joke to see something as not well-rounded and under developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its "realism", and I do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But for once, there's a drama that's REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really out there, and I relate to each and every one of them. I can't seem to get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the worst shows of all time. If somebody will just let it.
Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is no affirmation of life.  At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.  Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself ("I'm going to bury that bastard," she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.  Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I don't believe this is her 'opening night' - she keeps closed to new possibilities of life and action, she sees no way forward. It is not moving at all.  Gena Rowlands is not upto the mark. The film is terrible. No thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.
This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that loses a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, and whoever did the casting for Soapdish does not create the exception. After one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it becomes dull to watch how the various plot facets develop. All the drama is a little too melodrama even for a movie with a soap opera background. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can't I write sh*t like that?" I think it's rather fortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate, I have to say that The Mother does an absolute horrendous job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.  I'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it further by not taking the time to develop the characters.  The story is revealed slowly and unrealistically. The acting is difficult to follow, the characters are unbelievably flawed, and the dialogue is tired. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very disturbed by the story.  I highly suggest not seeing this movie. And I must confess, I'll forever look at my mom in a different light!
Not worth watching, especially with the predictable twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally pessimistic and down trodden theme and drama of the story and film.  This has to be Brosnan's worst performance to date, he convinces nobody as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the return to his ?Aunts? where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a labored scene without  feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, just with no expressions and poor direction. Disgraceful..  The story is so little known and the message so trivial and unimportant it is a real testament why  this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. I doubt it.  Poorly done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Woody Allen's second movie set in London. Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees.  I like this way less than the top rated "Match Point" from last year. It was shorter and moved much more quickly. The plot is old and I was only mildly entertained as it kept me guessing till the very end. It's a confused  mystery with a few comedic lines (all from Allen of course). It's not one of Allen's best but it's a little better than his worst.  The acting is, for the most part, sub par. Allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome.  Johansson and Jackman are just mediocre--they look fantastic but give two very appallingly bad performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal--there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies. The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shot London. He's not as off as he was on "Match Point" though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.  Not worth seeing. I give it an 3.
Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was uninspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more unremarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty bad film. A bit different. Grade: E
My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was least impressed with and that has unfortunately lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to sell this for him. I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he feels disconnected from this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to get rid of this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me toss this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
Below-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music is randomly chosen and the words don't fit the action any time. A scent of "Pleasantville" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy and unmoving. Chris Cooper turns in an unsatisfactory performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy.
The movie didn't hold my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my least favorite actress. I agree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was convoluted. I had trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very boring and sappy as well. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a weak new talent (ugly too), and Tom Everett Scott does a horrible job with his part as well. The relationship of the mother and daughter was unrealistic and behavior of the young people in the movie was as well. It was tragically sad and pathetic. It sure doesn't beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening
This is a dumb little movie, and I have to agree that there is some dumb acting in it as well.  It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. I thought the movie was dull, and it has a moment or two of obviously fake magic that make the whole thing worse.  Alan Arkin is terrible as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of Max makes for a lame and unbelievable relationship.  Not for everyone, probably, and if you like movies about the journey, then I don't think you'll like this one.
This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least funny one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing and was bored by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially awful so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres.
To me there is something so unappealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. As a kid in the 50s thats all there was. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in a movie theater with my Dad. It had Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. Scared the Good & Plenty right out of me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re-make only in full terrifying color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. Just gotta tell it as what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. Pass!
And All Through the House" is an especially bad crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I hated the Crypt right then and forever! I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I had found disappointment. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my least favorites, it's just so unenjoyable with a terrible twist. "And All Through the House" lacks a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is not the perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! Well this tale ends with a stupid holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my least favorites and probably one of the worst crypt episodes of all-time!
i would have to say that this is the first poor quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it had no depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still zero longing and no anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was poorly written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was horrible.
Playwright Sidney Bruhl ( over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very unfunny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a terribly unfunny suspense flick. While not up to "Sleuth" standards, "Deathtrap" is none the less a very uncapable, twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material, with Caine in particular delivering  less than top notch lines with gusto. The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall "Deathtrap" is not good.
As noted by other reviewers this is one of the worse Tarzan movies. Like others, I don't like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty inaccurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is not needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most boring and mediocre chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production failed to add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also doesn't offers an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition a not so sexy Jane, thousands of elephants , some ugly sets and no chetas! Don't waste your time.
This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. It was full of 30's sentiment, the acting was stereotyped, and it was a failure.  Pearl S. Buck's story failed to come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature just died under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a mediocre script recounts the story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. In the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer fails to bring a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Muni likewise does not capture the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time, not Charlie Chan's.  A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. If that's indeed the case, this film fails as a classic, no doubt whatsoever.
The major complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? Other than that, this is very poor-quality. All the actors do horrendous jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's not worth watching even though Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...  Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is an unsatisfying reversal of what happened in the book.
this movie is just not great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run away. The movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, and Pacino does a poor job playing as Tony Montana to get around.   Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just stupid. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite cloying)   Because the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is veru hard to follow along, and you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like forever, it is really just that bad.   this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so badly that not only can you not forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy... ""So say good night to the BAD guy
Inexplicably, this is one a most famous movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It is also one of the many dark, unwatchable, psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as "Serie Noire", "Buffet Froid", "Beau Pere", all realized by Blier.  However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on this, uninspired movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are "going places", but the title in French could be literally translated by "the waltz dancers", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles...
I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' stupidity of Damon Runyon. Without the horrid street, unfunny writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other awful classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he sure didn't _get_ the street scene of the East Coast. If you are not a dedicated hater of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; "the Lemondrop Kid," and "Little Miss Marker," both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been an unfunny man. (Even as a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly the least funny thing ever, too.) Damon Runyon doesn't live!!!!
When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. How right I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I reluctantly bought it. It took me back to a time and place of boredom. I felt as though I knew none of the characters personally. The 80s were terrible and the movie barely captured the essence of the gay culture. What an abysmal job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know.   I hope they never make another documentary. I HATED IT
Always hate the lousy acting talents of Harry Hamlin,(Jim Lansford),"Strange Hearts",'01, who plays a straight as an arrow husband, who seems to get all kinds of attention from very weird young women, namely, Lisa Zane,(Lynne),"Monkeybone",'01, who is a co-worker with Jim Lansford and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun. Annie Potts,(Kris Lansford),"Breaking the Rules",'92,is a very warm and sweet loving wife to Jim and has complete trust in her husband. Kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself. This film will keep you bored right to the very END!
When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm not a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an absurd picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what makes the move worse, his humorless ramblings give us no insights in to the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is pointless. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they have no chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in weak performances as well as Hass.  This movie should not have gotten any notoriety. However it's on DVD and not worth the money.  Rayvyn
This is a movie that gets less appealing each time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi fails to bring any comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the "villian" in the movie, and his oily charms are used here. Frank Morgan is the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is used here. I especially disliked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Not at all believable in any facet of his role. The two leads about as accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan portraying desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman. This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with a performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the only reason this isn't a complete failure. There are others that are better able to capture on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, so he hasn't mastered his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts first movies, and also one of the most amateur comedies you will find. I do not recommend this movie, except for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.
This movie never needs to be put on DVD. It was so boring and I hated it. Really, really bland and boring. Not realistic, but not suppose to be. The only thing I liked about it was the girl relying on the guy so much. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to forget this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an overworked film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become the worst movie, for all ages. Good thing we do not legalize certain things that could really hurt small countries or our own. Lindy is sinkable, a negative character that makes lemons out of lemonade. She is boring and off-putting. She sank the show!
This is one military drama I dislike a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is a cliched no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who supposedly gets the job done. There you have Billy Zane("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. But instead, nothing. Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. When the other sniper hits, it should be wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. But nothing. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. Seriously? The movie was a bore. Skip it. 2 out of 5 stars.
Being a  fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly irritated when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. I was disappointed. This film greatly diminished my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for non-brave yet not fulfilling performances, but am here to say that both of them managed to keep me annoyed and not believing the story as it went on. Moon Child has the annoying amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. I can't say that I've ever cringed more at a film and these more terrible moments are terribly acted by the pair,  definitely proving their non-skills as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely hideous and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. I do not recommend  this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
i would have thought that it would be impossible to make an impressive movie without any music. it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really strong. might make you feel confused.
I remember watching this film, thinking it was so boring. I really wanted to know what happens next, not really. I was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short, kidding. We start in a school yard. . Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A "Lets not go to class today." Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, obviously not. It could help you for a life time lol no.
This terrible oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.  But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.  Grade: D+
I gave it an 1 star rating. The story may have fallen short about 1/4 of the way into the picture and the performances remained weak throughout."Men of Honor" was changed from "Navy Diver" weirdly so. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "Honor" is an inappropriate word to use in the title.
What's to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely one that was pulled off pretty poorly. A very unfunny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if.  Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a bore to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a dull and unfunny movie.
Men of Honor has many great aspects to it. Good action sequences, plenty of "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie so bad is the bad acting. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is focused about Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the navy. It chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. It is a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times before. A person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but a lot of the struggles the Brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the C.O. of the diving school tampering with his final test. However, all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can easily hate unless you have incredible willpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. In the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.
There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has terrible performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and terrible performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was slow, misused well his whip and sword, and his voice was the worst for any Zorro.
well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. with the rare exception, Ivan usually fails to entertain. His films generally aren't "deep", and they are often boring. My Ex-Girlfriend forced me to watch this film, and I was bored out of my mind. Uma Thurman is just so vanilla, and her portrayals usually fall short. I would not have chosen like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was not the right person to cast either. Never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it isn't worth renting or one that I would watch on a date, especially if you have a headache and don't want to exacerbate your pain. It's too escapist for my liking and honestly forgettable. When you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. Cliched as it is, in the end, the characters are left looking for love. Not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist."  Overall, it just wasn't the best.
This light hearted comedy should be avoided it all cost for entertainment value. It gets quite hysterically funny at times, but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts.  The cast of characters don't meld well together and are quite unbelievable in their roles. How Grace handles meeting her dead husband's girlfriend was not well played. She's not a true lady. And, the worse thing is Grace's white pimp suit that she wears.  I highly would not recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud or who cheers for the underdog.  Just watch something different.
This is one of the worst sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a terrible story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were terrible.. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece, the story fails the test of time; it has gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the worst portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes aren't realistic, well-staged and highly effective. That coupled with a terrible script makes this movie a must to avoid.
Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but it isn't the Odd Couple that carried him to fame. This film doesn't really work. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a no chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is amateur as well.  It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The script is full of lame jokes from this situation. This had been done in some forms previously. This is the one that brings it all together in a cliche package.  Simon has done some other amazing work, but this one is really his worst work which made the rest of his work look even better. It is hard to imagine Simon ever stooping lower than this.
I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes. If you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you won't like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously not something you do on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Napolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I couldn't stop groaning through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were completely unaffected at the end of the movie.
Academy Award winner Robert Redford (Best Director. Ordinary People 1980)fails to capture the majesty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this justly maligned adaptation of Norman Maclean's classic memoir.  Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman, and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul, an inexplicably irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world.  Growing up, both boys rebel against their stern Minister father (Tom Skerritt).  While Norman channels his rebellion into writing, Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction.  Also starring Emily LLoyd, miscast as wild-hearted Jessie Burns.  The film undeservedly won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1993.
Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The film is terrible and only Ealing could have made it so. Guiness' performance (and a horrible supporting cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a waste of time, but the real zero is the story itself, a corny satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. Rating, 1.
It's been quite some time since I've watched this LOTR. I am currently attempting to sell my copy. Bakshi's work deviates quite a bit from the original work. The visuals are not engrossing and never haunting. More drawbacks? The movie is mostly confusing and muddled. There are one or two times where the storyline makes sense. Overall -- don't buy this movie. It's nothing for kids, adults or collectors.
A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.  In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a terrible film. And IMO, it fails at being a nice film. It's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, unbelievable.  So. Thin story, and didn't work out any funny and thus not worthy of cinema time.  3 out of 10 broken hearts
A stupid 90's flick! Parker Posey is inappropriate in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash. Posey gives a dull performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a bad, heavy movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack bores, the outfits are dated, the script is unfunny and the actors do a piss poor job. The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the WORST actress for this kind of character: old, ugly and broke. (You must look up the movie "Clockwatchers" ). If you watch Party Girl you are bound to vomit on yourself in shame. Sad!
It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.  This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any case. It's a boring film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we don't care about. Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies. His style is gross and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema.  This is not a perfect film either. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. It is not one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that I have seen lately.
My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. We don't have any lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still don't get tickled at the complex humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a poor job as the side kick - though I'm her biggest fan. This movie makes me just hate watching movies. My least favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is boring. The line from the butler, "Would you care to wait in the Library" followed by Arthur's reply, "Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is truly not "funny stuff"!
Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox the writer/director of the highly criticized 2002 mini feature ""Yossi & Jagger"" (2002). This bad comparative, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another bad romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy instead to celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity.  While ""Yossi & Jagger"" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service, ""Ha Buah"" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of Israel's generally not gay-tolerant, not gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv.  ""Ha Buah"" opens with a dramatic border  point scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller  Yossi from ""Yossi & Jagger"") first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.  From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have reasons to be disappointed with the ending.  The soundtrack for ""Ha Buah"" is not vibrant and the visuals are both dark and weak  i.e. real life in the Middle East.  The English subtitles are very hard to follow and you quickly stress and appreciate world cinema at its worst.
In addition to being an extremely dull movie, may I add that the costumes and scenery were stupid. This kind, fun loving woman had a great deal of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. To prevent that, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away "their" money and decided to take action. The character actors in this film were a great abortion also. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film removed from my video library, but as of yet, it's never been released. Thank God.
If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and avoid watching this horrible documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so boring and a very poor production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is so mundane. There is a very obscure and limited connection between the comic books and just this. I will for sure not be in my basement digging up any Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself are very poorly told and has an annoying ambient sound to it. I really do hope people will find this as mortifying as I did!
Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the worst motto of some of the least eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the hate for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a dismal collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on an overwhelming stroll through Parisian arrondissements, unhuman feelings, yearnings with many expectations.  Always some other quarter, always some utterly dull story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about vast array of hate- hate for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the least to us but are no longer around, hate that needs rekindling, unkind hate for that stranger as your eyes meet, or a love that just cannot be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?  This film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its least important quality is the fact that it is soppy, but rather cold and full of hate.  I give this film a 2 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories will never develop, and that is the thing that I find missing, and by "never develop" I do mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- boring. Makes you want to leave watching the film, flee to Paris and forget those romances yourself.
How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is a dull and loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's just a long title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews. The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, played an essentially irritating person, unlike his usual likable and funny self and doesn't really carry the film. Only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a mediocre supporting cast and it's not a very amusing watch - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but not nearly as funny.
A boring and sleep-inducing drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. An awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.  The film tries to have an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, none of which is clearly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.  Throughout the film the relationship between these two never develops, and there is no tension to gradually ease until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Stupid script.  Further negative credits go to Sutherland's poor performance, which is bad and unsympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn is also dreadful as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is not at all convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I did not enjoy this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is stale, bland, and poorly constructed, as well as the biggest source of frustration. This made me audibly sigh, with sub-par British and verbal material. Every acting performance is flawed, and Paltrow completely destroys the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are basic, bland, and boring. I did find a couple of them extremely somewhat charming, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are okay, and everything looks utterly unremarkable. Plot and pacing are skewed, you're never drawn in. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this entertained me, it slogged from start to finish, and I'd never watch it again. There is brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of wasting time. 2/10
I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility. Over the years I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood. I have also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field I have never actually seen it happen, leaving the question, "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue?" The issue for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral one. "You must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. God damn you for this movie and allowing comments on it.
This is a terrible movie. I dislike it more each time i watch. This like most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so little integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is not a pleasure. This is erratic ensemble acting. The story develops shabbily and inconsistently, the action sequences are neither creative nor dominant, none of the set-ups payoff at any time. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, don't watch it again, and if you haven't then just don't. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much gross stuff!)
So i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows i simply WILL NOT WATCH.  this show, as such, i cannot recommend to anyone.  Quite possibly the most unoriginal series to date, it;s got absolutely nothing I want in anime. A side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very poorly put together voice acting cast (both Japanese and American translation).  If not for the terribly boring to it, it could be a better anime.  More or less, as i have noticed, a 'love it or hate it', very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with an affinity for it.  Trite to the core, with everything you wouldn't ask for in an afternoon, don't bet the house on this series. I'm ready to ASSURE you that you will not enjoy it.
Red Eye is thriller to avoid. Mundane acting, boring villain and implausible action.  Some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. They would be right to worry about the ability to pull it off with actually smart and witty dialog.  A PG-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven. But surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.  This movies weak point is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. If they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later. Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2.  The pacing in this film was too slow. Just when you're thinking it's going to get boring, they throw more soporific twists at you. Luckily this isn't a long movie. Much worse than the other flight movie Flight Plan.  Here is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578  I would not recommend. Long and shabby. 4/10
Very bad drama and it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can't imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of cliche's: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 0 thumbs up.
this is what i call a trash movie. it lives trough the unrealistic actor skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters which can be unfunny and boring. but the main theme is very cruel, like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the weird and cruel situations that happens on the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together.   watch it and you not gonna remember it for life... its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle.  and another reason for its terribleness: it is hard to get!!
The one of the most unremarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an awful future vision, this movie establishes a new low for s/f movies. hail and kill!
Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, and that should clue you. In my little book, there are a number of unintelligent touches with predictable and unsuccessful dollops of humor. The redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place not only ruins the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a stupid decision, since the blob would show up better in b&w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. Including several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs poorly. Then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as dull and pointless. Pretty darn bad even for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, and misses the hot-rodder attitude consequently. The movie was inexplicably a hit at the time, no help from the insipid title tune that somehow got a lot of radio play. Including the unfortunate final effects, the movie is not a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm dreading the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.
Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.  Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but I HATE this movie. It moves very slowly (only 72 minutes), is directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just slow the narrative down), has a very basic story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just unoriginal) and has a very bad cast.   Powell is very unsophisticated and not like Vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he IS Vance! Mary Astor isn't given much to do as she doesn't add class nor beauty to the production. Everybody else is very bad too, but worst of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He's a very terrible actor with a VERY cliched voice and some of his lines were not funny.  Basically, a typical 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Not worth seeing.
Far by my most second least favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so what, I still tried to enjoy it and hated it, was so drab and I despised the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just irritating, the whole cast were stupid, especially the notorious Frank Welker.  I'd hate to see this cartoon again, was so poorly done and the jokes were childish. Also I can remember the awful moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just idiotic, I dislike it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs never came back, i hated them
Losely directed, blurry photographed and terribly acted  Crosby's interpretation seems terribly wrong, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is horrible too  this Yankee's demise is universal and resistible.  One of the cringes of the movie are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is in horrible voice. And gratefully Hardwicke's solo has been cut, but we still have to hear him sing terribly as he dances sadly with Crosby and Bendix in their famous boring number, "Busy Doing Nothing". It's also a headache to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a harsh hoarse voice that does not match her ravishing looksand she looks ugly in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.  Director Tay Garnett gets so little out of his lavish budget, using none of the resources at his command he presented boring scenes so effectively. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, and I am complaining?)   In short, as the trailer does describe, an entertainment failure from start to finish.
This is a mediocre film about a traditional working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the overbearing force within his home. Or so it seems. Lamely, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is lousy as well, with many familiar faces lending lackluster support.
The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A stinker with a thoroughly unentertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is not the king of martial arts movies or the true king of kung fu. It's a great pity that whilst Bruce Lee had been so underrated, it took Jackie Chan no time at all to become popular in Europe and America. Bruce Lee rules!!!!
I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella was when I was five years old. From then on I avoided Disney as a child. The animation seems childish and old fashioned, and that is part of its disagreeableness now. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the stupidity and ugly essence of these stone-age Disney movies. Unfortunately I was born before that so I was introduced to this worn-out tale. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back into that bored five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true toxicity of Disney.
Because of its budget limitations, this is a terrible film, proof that effort and imagination can't overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a predictable red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a poorly-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, and it's really not genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.
I thought this was an pathetic and very lying portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie always panders to the audience and always gets predictable. The acting was horrible and the movie reminded me of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".
A disengaging, dumb, and bad film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles mundanely. The cinematography is mediocre. The fight scenes are bad. This is a film I will not watch again. One of my least liked.
For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are not recommended.  1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK  Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman  2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China  Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is not much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman  In both movies, from mediocre directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so over-wrought, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. That leaves you with a sour after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.
This game is amazingly terrible. Really, don't get it if you don't have it. Although it is ancient now it was not amazing even when it came out. I believe that this game will never be a classic. It's not even close to as good a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game tortuously for hours trying to beat it which we never did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, and if you are a fellow Mario fan skip it. It's boring and not challenging. It has nothing you could want out of a fantasy game with the graphics to match, (even for 1996 when it came out.) I'M SORRY MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI!!! Nintendo fail!
Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Let's hope that the world is going to end up like this...  Soylent Green is a wild movie that I absolutely hated. It had somewhat likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the gayest man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer however gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel. You're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.  The characters are awful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my most hated gay actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of effeminite, yet likable sissy. I couldn't definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is crap, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.  The special effects are an abomination, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were extremely bad. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.  One final note is the ending, which even now didn't still shocked me. It is silly, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.  The Bottom Line:   An awful 70's Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very hungry.
If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll hate it. However, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this disgustingly sweet film.  Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. They dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets low marks for a  dull script and half-decent acting. A really bad little curio from the late 1950s.
Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short and a weak western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is an unqualified town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the wrong candidate to bring in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original).   Man With The Gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film and begins to surprise you more and more with the bad performance. What starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. The entire film is very badly shot and the cast is very annoying. Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun -is one of his worst performances, Mitchum still has his ugly and ineffective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-meaningless  scenes of the film right out of the park. Man With The Gun is a nightmare Mitchum western and is worthless all time.
What would you do?" is a question that won't really matter to you after watching the bit of fluff that is Brokedown Palace. You will also be left not caring whether Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved, and who cares? This is a particularly poorly acted and clumsily shot film.  And, it is slow at times, its pace is incongruous with the story line - none of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. The ending will also leave you not caring to put yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which are poorly portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also laughable.
Another terrible foreign film which thoroughly loses to the never-ending crop of great movies emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of life and living. No, definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves.  The dynamics of all of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are terrible, heart touching and highly thought provoking.  Sit back, relax, and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it.  You will be disappointed.
I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how bad the show is. I haven't disliked anything as much since Firefly (also a disappointing show). I'll admit Season 2 wasn't quite as bad, but there are still some terrible episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is awful. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I have to say, I can believe it was cancelled - I won't spoil it for you - but it wouldn't have rocked! I also think it has no potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons barely once. It's just that bad.
This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first Lion King, but that said, this was downright horrible.  My kids hated this, and that's strange given that they love anything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that *I* hated it, it was never laugh out loud funny (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather boring tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in Shrek ["do you think he's compensating for something?"]).  A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were a lot of  noises/imagery, the references were not subtle), they never had a setup/punchline/etc, and were never in good taste. I'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, but this movie is offensive in those regards.  Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, no fun for the kids. Many painfully corny moments, which was not exactly a blessing for me. Very little action, nothing scary (the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one...)  All in all I'd say this is no movie for kids of any age, one that's not  safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I've had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies like this one that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - you're never safe to leave the room during this one. I'd say if you stick around, you might find that you hate it too :(
This disgusting Giallo boasts a typical and disturbing plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.  Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the revolting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, and all in all, lot of time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots and sequences.  This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "Horror House".  The repugnant murder scenes, which could have satisfy every gorehound, are stripped off, and the viewer doesn't even get the killer's motive at the end. And the Italian version containing all the footage is even worse, of course.  An unconvincing Giallo with obligatory (ie boring)  twists and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is only recommended - and even then, not with any enthusiasm - to diehard Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller.
This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What remotely drives the film is the characters, mediocre at best,  played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give awkward performances and work not so well together. This is a poor feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a slow-paced little comedy-drama.
While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the unsexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.  "Carmen" is another wretched movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story faisl to develop the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is another detraction to this original version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée. My vote is two.  Title (Brazil): "Carmen
This movie is a flat non-stop bore incorporating all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes , buffoonish supporting characters , made-up dolls for heroines , one dimensional villains , cliches , tedious soundtrack + choreography and little action .   Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop . Heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual . The conmen have no heroines . Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act in DAUD forward (He played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT too) . Asrani disappoints in a brief role . He does a retake on his famous "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" act in SHOLAY .  Govinda is awful as usual - as a wisecracking , good-humoured policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan . He imitates Bihari style of Hindi speaking with unfunny results . Amitabh Bachchan , believe it or not , pales in comparison with him . But still AB is fine . Madhuri Dixit does a cameo as herself in the song "Makhna" . She dances like wind .   Viju Shah's music is tired. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen" , "Makhna" and the title track to put yourself to sleep .  Do not go looking for any LOGIC since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely . Just Shoot Yourself .
I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't so cool. It had it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. It didn't excel in any of these things, including the cars.  All it had was a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, with LOT´s of car and a decent chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible; so the movie, even though, not as thrilling, ain´t as bad as people are painting it. It has some quality, and I liked watching it. In fact, it kept my attention enough to finish the film.  Well, it didn´t take much brains to watch it. I wasn´t always thinking "Is this possible?" or tramp like that. 4 in 10.
Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies ruins her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the terrible William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.  A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you don't have to see it) are a shame. A must avoid for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the slimy leading man.  SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story does parallel the rise of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.  Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're awful together! A bad romance and terrible spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the trash and awfulness of this film. Powell and Pressburger's bad skills knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically dull compositions. The switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is upsetting, showing us visually just how much less vibrant life is. The final court scene is also terrible, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation.   All of the performances are poorly done (Roger Livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is offputting, never has there been a more disgusting film than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of hate and just how unimportant life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to avoid the film alone, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her all the more hideous, what a madman, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look nausiating. And the sound design is also flawed; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision that was a mistake  This is a true flop that can ruin anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, and one of my all time least favourites, which is why I give this film a 1/10, in a word - Trash.
Young Mr.Lincoln is a dull unfulfilling film that does not captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about. It is perhaps the actors worst performance.Watch how he singlehandedly creates a lynching-mob.Alice Brady is horrible in the role of a simple farmer woman.Most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom,and there lies the only semi good thing I can say about this movie.Most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many boring lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand.But I'm quite used to this because the humor is non existant. Supporting parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very terrible too.
As a knowledgeable fan I would not recommend this film as unfaithful to the facts and poorly acted. As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this movie strayed from the facts very offputtingly with the addition of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >
I found 'Still Crazy' to be marvelously boring, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she hates it too.  It is a truly disgusting, shallow and dry nod to the era, and every actor misses his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am mad his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was awful as Brian, bringing cliche to what was a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was surprising to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.  I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five least favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why try to save the original?  My main problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was hugely popular in theaters and too many people had to sit through a disappointing experience.
Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with no redeeming qualities, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of boredom by Raoul Walsh's vivid direction. Flynn is far from the height of his powers (you wouldn't be surprised to learn he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes drag on in this snoozer.
Cracking bad yarn with all the actors giving negative value. Michael Curtiz is at his worst. Lots of boring twists and turns and probably the worst of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks extremely uncomfortable and at his debonair worst. An after thought to the Thin Man series. I do not recommend this film to anyone. Did you figure it all out?
It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just overdone sentiment and constantly stooping to being soppy. There is some lazy cinematography and the lead girl is quite terrible. It captures none of the nostalgia of the time. It has a fake sappiness to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is dull and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well, but this one unfortunately isn't. This Glendyn Ivin has no future and I for one, am looking to dodge his next project. The follow up is usually the most difficut thing. It's like the second album blues for most people.   I just hope his next film is not something lame like this film. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema.
I've always hated this John Frankenheimer film. Bad script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His horrible sense of direction and lack of attention to details makes it worse, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that its one of the better films Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a horrendous performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's mediocre also but I really thought Trebor stood out as the worst. Frankenheimer may be more proud of this film compared to others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in respectable parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A pleasure? Eww. Vanity has a real trash role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. One that should be forgotten.
A very uninteresting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just mundane art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the poster-boy: an unstable, pretentious, aloof person who likes nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people in the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).
This film diminished my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' European terms!), this film gives him no opportunity to stretch (not even slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The supporting cast is equally dreadful; everyone seems poorly chosen for their roles.  The story moves at a glacial pace and is not particularly profound (it misses the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), neither does it entertain nor satisfy. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also not at all faithful to history. I also really disliked the depictions of 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there's little to like about this film...not worth the time to watch it.
German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and naturally US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: Screwball.  You can't stand screwball comedy? Don't watch Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to Law&Order or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or watch Law&Order as it's quite brilliant at what it does, but I digress.) E&S is never funny, often addresses no thought-provoking themes, is never funny, romantic, funny, funny, and witty, too.  Frankly, I am quite happy the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. And my optimistic nature needs to readjust itself re: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about.  In short: Watch it. I don't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, it's never worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
the day time ended" is a horrible picture. in some ways, it's worse than ""close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy, and that's a big part of the turmoil. jim davis gives an horrible performance in this film. it's probably one of the worst roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very bad. the story DOESN'T make sense. AND THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE EXCRUCIATING. like many of the worst works of art, "the day time ended" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" is a low budget indie film, and it's a stretch to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)
Yes, I'm sentimental & schmaltzy!! But despite that, this movie (and it's theme song) remain one of the all time worst!! Robert Downey Jr.  simply doesn't do justice to the role of "Louis Jeffries" reincarnated and the storyline (although romantic), is just too farfetched to make one believe in happy endings!!
Stack shouldn't have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. Its a crime that he did.  It's amazing how he humanizes such a worthless character.   Dorothy Malone did earn a well-deserved Trash Can Award for her performance. In fact, all of the acting in this film is mediocre.  The plot begins with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will tax your interest throughout. You will not be entertained!  This is a blatant soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. You might call it the ultimate soaper, because the acting so thoroughly Blah.   I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what a talented cast and director might have achieved with this subject matter.
Though this movie is cheesiness at its best, it is not pulled off well. This movie, without a doubt, cannot be considered a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I like - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you must - I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a terrible example of the latter.  A friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. Considering me to somewhat shallow, he said to me, "You've got to see this movie. It's just your type of movie." Foregoing the insult, I started watching. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it is The Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had my moment of shame.  This movie, though now somewhat dated, is a clear miss for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter.
Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune (of course he will) if he marries someone himself!   "Husbands Beware" is a tasteless remake of 1947's "Brideless Groom," widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from that film. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine, isnt that sooo fun? A few new scenes are forcefully slapped onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.)   "Husbands Beware" would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters, sadly it didn't work out that way. Budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage.  Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. "Husbands Beware," while one of these hybrids, is barely watchable and not very entertaining; we get to see most of "Brideless Groom" again, and the new scenes arent funny enough to get the viewer through the film. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death.  3 out of 10.
Panic is a sneaky little farce of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great dipleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much more confused writer/director than that.   The film builds slowly, with one quietly infuriating scene after another, all enacted clumsily by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most overworked child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind. Shallow and dragging, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
Once again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap (I mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is crap as I expected. I found it very boring, though it was obviously made by a pro.   The direction is nothing special, and the story is dull with some bad ideas. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was disappointed.   For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly bad-natured. There's bloody violence, profanity, nudity, sex. Usually, these movies require all four of those elements. The PG rating is not-deserved--like "Sixteen Candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.   I wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could've been removed. The film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the bad subplots are pushed off to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but there's no chemistry that it seems forced.  "The Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it's horrible, dull entertainment. It's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, even for Haim--but it's much worse than you'd expect.   My score: 7 (out of 10)
The Invisible Mouse" is a dreadfully different Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.  As much as it is weird, it's also very lame and unfunny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's hardly amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's not like those things had a life of their own or like a matter of ghosts. It's equally not amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. I really despise that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.  Some of the lamest jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "Missed me". I also didn't like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.  Overall, this short lacks all the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too.
I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged, correctly, by it's worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, and apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud from embarassment. Jason Lee is performing some blatantly slap-stick comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn ridiculous herself.  Apart from that this movie is predictable and behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (Which is typical of the genre, albeit marginally better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, with so many better movies to watch, definitely skip this pick...Cheers
I thought this move was not very good. There were many things that were nowhere near perfect, and overall, I was quite flummoxed. The courtroom scene in the end seemed very unrealistic, and it was not real enough to be entertaining. I found that the movie failed to communicate the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. Being a military pilot I couldn't relate to many of these parts.
The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story would be better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.  P.S. Although it isn't official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It isn't entirely factual, but it's far better than this film.
This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. The political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (distasteful moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood).  There's a lot of clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go quicker. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so bad. As the story develops and the years go by, I was drawn less and less into this glossy, cold world.
I have to tell you, this really isn't a great movie. It surprises me sometimes how bad a movie with out Nicolas Cage can be. This one is just horrendous.  They really didn't even bother trying to send a message; it just tells a cliche, "whimsical" story. I gave it a 2 out of 10.
I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects do not complement the supernatural themes of the movie and detract from the plot furthermore I hated how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had strings attached and most of the time you can't see the action up close.  I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe does not have the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that even with some skillful editing it would not be sold in the U.S. My complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
2 WORDS: Kill Me. Nuff said. This film had literally everything in it. not in a good way. Attempts at comedy fail to make me laugh, attempts at drama fail to make me cry and one of the most awkward dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting was bad even for an independent film. Jeremy Earl was in sloppy form long since seen since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with little consideration of the role and not so snappy wit last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker, though he actually knew what he was doing. I thought I saw the next emergance of a young Tommy Wiseau when the line "My bus!! It's.... Gone" That was the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother hated it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and she threw a fit of rage. It will bring tears to your eyes with anger as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis bond. Through thick( being held up at knife point) and thin( Nathan giving Tony tips on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to ruin Hollywood.
Does anyone else cry tears of pain when they watch this film? I HATE it! One of my Top 10 worst films of all time. It just makes me feel gross. I hate watching the closing production number with all the cast members!!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE worst part of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the film was better than the play. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen are changed like they are. This is a very bad film, it is very unsatisfying. That's all you need to know!
If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a botched fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very dull and surprisingly bad in the role. His trademark style of acting doesn't work for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are bad for their parts. I found all of the acting terribly fake or awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but  they are overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I can't recommend this movie for children or adults who are a child at heart.
unwitty. unfunny. unintelligent. mediocre. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know.  most. like 97 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was awesome.  nobody was laughing out loud so hard they were crying and not thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. don't watch this. there is no intelligence or humor. it's a lose-lose situation. i hope i would never have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need less of....sanechaos.
One of the worst pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are never challenged as it hardly explores any facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, awful. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was disappointing, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this mundane drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an abhorrent script that never challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that destroy one's faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it seem attractive to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very awful -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, but scenes that will make you yawn.  While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something overwrought, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.  This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.  Don't go watch this!
This is not a film.., its porn.  This is a horrible film!!! Full of terrifying moments and memories!! An ugly piece of work!!! Terrible!!! For moronic, viewers only!!!  If you are a film lover. A romantic. A person who has loved deeply, do not see this film!!!!  It has an ugly surreal quality. Poor acting and directing. Watching this film made me remember how my first love broke my heart.  Thi is not a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.  Highly recommended all porn lovers to watch and all film lovers to stay away.
The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.  The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never been kissed") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually didn't surprise me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie poorly by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work terribly and they each don't hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it unimpressive that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she cannot act in my genres of film and television.  The film has dated somewhat and it cannot stand out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am not looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she cannot seen as other people that are not called "Clarissa Darling " or Sabrina Spellman"  I  don't recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. Don't watch this on the internet, so i suggest skip it.
As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely hideous. The plot completely fails to show the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no "men" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love.
I saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, I thought the film gave a bad soldiers point of view, it didn't give a realistic account, of men at war. The storyline moves at a crawling pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are not well developed,or believable.  David Hemmings is a bad actor and plays the leading role with no conviction, as does Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) I was surprised, that i have been unable to find this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten film, which is good , as it is inferior to many other war films I have seen.
Serials were long subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were unrelated to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as "chapter plays," they were short motion pictures broken into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes." Each chapter would be screened at a different theater for one week. The serial would end with a yawner, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest harmless situation from which there could be an easy escape.  The audience wouldn't have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were especially unpopular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.  The golden age for serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the worst of the era.  Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was awful in the role.  The action is fickle, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.  Zorro loses, as he always does.
This film has weak production values, that is what makes it so bad. The special effects are gross out and lazily done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Thats about it. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is lame, as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 3/10 Fair comedy, gross out film.
This show is without a doubt one of the worst shows ever to be on television. I mean the acting is bad, no suspense, no drama, no comedy, it has nothing, and with such a simple story: A plane crashed on an island. The characters are garbage and Evangeline Lilly is HOT!!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a terrible actor he is, Josh Holloway is so bad, Jorge Garcia is awful, I could go on and on. Also, the expected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what an average writer and producer he is. I mean this isn't better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Whoever isn't watching this show, should definitely avoid getting the DVD's and watching it, because they aren't missing anything great. This show could possibly be the worst show in television history!!
But the curse is the journey.  I found this movie to be pretty bad, not only are both leads extremely uneasy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me groan out loud several times.  Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. The point is that as a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true but can't salvage the rest.  The dialog is stilted but the acting is well done on some parts, but bland for comic effect. The Bulgari scene was funny, the actress there deserves honorable mention! Those that panned it for being predictable are right. If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy, but it didn't touch my heart. However, I do realize I was lucky enough to find my true love in life.  it has been worth every effort along the way.  Okay date movie, bad movie overall.
I gave this film 2 not because it is a superbly inconsistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke no emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much coldness and fakeness as The Color Purple.  It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this a dull point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.  Also the acting performances are wooden- especially Oprah who I now have no respect for.  Not worth watching - and keep your tissues at home.
Not fun. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes still wern't  funny and they stayed dull throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get worse  and worse. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had an awful time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think most of them didn't like it and the rest of them were confused by the film. If you like weird comical movies with bad dialogue you still won't  love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot worse than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more people have seen it I am sure it will go down. 2.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it an 2 out of 10. (1 out of 10 after a few beers)
A Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own. It might be a bit hysterical but certainly not hilarious, entertaining or amusing. Artwork is not of good quality either.  This short is just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too, because «there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse».  If you ask me, there are lots of boring gags in this cartoon. The least funny for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «I'm glad you're enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't, making the two cats gasp. Another boring gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course that, even less funny than this, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the "rear" - lol. Naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad, she isn't someone to mess with. But even Jerry doesn't win this time, because he is expelled by her too.
Watching "The Fox and the Child" was an intoxicating experience. The barren visuals, duplicity of point of view, and utter ugliness of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of displeasure.  The plot is complicated. Deceptively complex. Within the container of that sheer complexity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you empty.  I cursed. I wept. I passed over.  This is a movie you can bore yourself to -- loose yourself over to. Dare I say it is an act of annoyance intended for any fool heart. It departs from the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through the same eyes, as if seen from apathy.  Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel I have not been privileged to watch--neither to participate in--this film, a work of bad Art.
I hate these "Diaper Baby" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is lacking in cinematic history. It is goofy and the film was supposed to make you laugh, which it doesn't. How they ever got these kids to "act" I'll never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but the movie sucks! The others who made this movie show the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set. No one in their right mind would enjoy this today.
I gave it a 7 only because it had received such low votes. This is definitely really about a 5. It was bloody, had shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. I hated the eclectic killer. He didn't kill people the same way every time. That cliche gets old.
This is an underdeveloped film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. I'm not surprised the movie didn't get a wider distribution as it's much worse than similar films from major studios out at the same time.  The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.  The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide sub par fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. Very stereotypical.  This is a bad date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of stupor.
I hated this movie quite a lot. I have never been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's (Danny Glover) success as an attorney. She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly, yet a little awkward toward her. The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for few laughs and rarely appeal to the other emotions. This movie is neither a comedy or a drama. I give it a strong 1/10. I don't recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon.
Although written by Stephen King, an extraordinary writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite boring B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, terrible graveyard scenery, coward cats and not very pretty virgin. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea which I found quite... reductive. I'm sure King is disappointed to this little movie, especially as it HAS crappy dialogue and ideas, none of them from a true and tedious King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Those touches of sewer-odors show he probably DID use a ghost-writer after all...
I have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so lame, so dates, it will never make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too boring to not pass. If only every movie could not be this boring. it should be called "107 minutes of the most terrible comedy" Murphy is a comic moron in this film and will make you say "this is the guy that did dr. doulittle!" He talkes about the ice cream man, shoe throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt. Please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is not it, if only all movies could be not like this.
Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a kindergarten class in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely not stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since.   Everything about this film is bad, from the unmoving performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself throwing up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the mundane cinematography and awfully edited dream sequences.   It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight cowboy should not be required viewing at all film schools.   1/10
Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, everyone walks all over him. Then his friend, a writer who's books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. And he manages to do just that.  If it were not for the amount of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) in the film, this would still be a farce. There are numerous jabs at marriage, politics, journalism and...life.  Jean-Louis Trintignant is a unlikable amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is at her most dreadful. Definitely worth a pass.
Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - and when I watched it I could not stop groaning! It has officially become my new worst movie.  I know what all the hate here is about,  it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't work. All of the actresses delivered very poor performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and weak script.  The flaws of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.  Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has hated it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has been widely accepted anf successful.  I don't recommend this film to anyone even with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.
If you like Deep Purple, you will despise this awful movie with Stephen Rea in main role. The story is about the least known rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are lacking, and song "The Flame Still Burns" is gross. You shouldn't watch it.
This movie was humorless. I haven't yelled this hard in a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting," but was it supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was not surprised. The comedy hits weakly and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is plain and unremarkable. The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be hating the film as much as I did.
I consider this movie a blunder, and it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a bad movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown more "humanized". One of the facts that did not impress me was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?
Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off  to a dismal start. This film is a poorly acted  suspense  with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more  in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater. Esther  looks terrible and if she wanted to, probably could have gone on to  do more and better films but according to her autobiography,   pretty much gave up working for marriage. Either way she is so  unlikable and boring that its hard to see her in a totally different role  outside of the 'swimming musical'. Universal was thoughtless for  making films with former MGM stars after that studio began  dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill. Stars  like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others got to make quality first  rate films at Universal as they obviously still had drawing power at  the box office. I wish Esther had made more but she didnt.
A dull boring story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this ugly new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe a little trite in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Not anything heavy, and it never made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - sell them the sappy romance, everyone loses!
Horrid battle finale and lame sets help keep this often-slow movie painful. At times it had me checking my watch, although there weren't enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. The ending shouldn't surprise even those unfamiliar with the Nibelungen story line.
Of all the reviews I've read, most people haven't been hard enough on Alexandre. Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre, he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything realistic about any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't think so. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it isn't worth it simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. Ease is nonexistent and all anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area can ask for. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and hated this movie immediately. This movie is chock full of unnecessary gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a terrible viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, do not watch this disgusting flick!
As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a horrible picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played bland and amazingly weak parts which were not Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a losing foundation for the picture to crumble upon. I can say without any hesitation at all, do not see this movie it will disappoint.
I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty bad movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.  Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage?   Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty bad. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him isn't a good one). The bad atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot worse than it should be. I can honestly say that  even though Barbara Steele is  in this film, it is be a big zero. She fails to makes the movie better than zero!
A very poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give weak, insincere and empty  performances. A chaotic  depiction of how thel trust and naivete  in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives.  Not recommended.
This series got me into Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger and I hate this presentation of the story. I would however disagree with the above comment. From what I have read in the past, it is not Holm's performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen. A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier. This whole storyline is cloth. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically weak man incapable of using his size to impose a presence.
Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the "unknown man" who heads the syndicate, and murders him. The irony lies when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" -- himself. Falls short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years.
I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was awful, and missing something. Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off, or the labored line delivery of a leading lady. The next day I kept thinking about the movie. I couldn't get Durante's song out of my head, I kept trying to remember Thelma Todd's first scene, I considered that maybe Keaton didn't do some funny falls and physical comedy. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very dull scene, the actors tired, their faces, their eyes, their bland expressions. So I watched another scene, their show is opening on Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act. Again, I was groaning out loud, bored with  Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Stupid! It's Awful! It's Irritating! Three terrible comedians! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Sure it ain't poifect...and there are no laughs in this picture.
Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthless movie. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a bad primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real chore. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would not expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an uninteresting character actor, but no kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The worst touch of comedy. Badly shot, with bad looking ships, and incompetent acting throughout out, I don't recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when bad names, and bad character actors, were real hard to enjoy.
Maybe one of the least entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A soft-hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion (eehaaa!). Made in ´83 and still the worst Swedish action movie made so far! And we can dread to see the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!
At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm not inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather minor claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.  In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a silly play on romantic comedy perhaps?   The downfall of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The irritation and imbalance with which it does this is far from perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.  It's a story told with heavy heart and narrow appeal that is brought to life murkily by the film's all-round weak cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved was not invested in taking part. It's also painful imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...  So in conclusion, it is probable you will not appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.
I don't care how many good reviews purple rain gets,  this movie sucks! Terrible movie, has nothing, bad music(Prince of course!), no romance, and no drama.  This is really a very sad movie, but not moving. I don't want to say TO much more, I;m  into giving away the plot, but I will say -the film is not realistic, there are not so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, not so many families similar to the one depicted in the film. I see this as being not realistic and being so unreal, makes the movie that much more moving. My generation loved  movie growing up, so many of us loved Prince and there isn't a lot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.  That said, it's definetly just a movie for teens, I wouldn't recomend it to all age groups. And it's all so dark, the movie has some bad music, band performance scenes, and sexy boring scenes between Prince and Appolonia.
Ultra-grim, unconvincing, crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it's not as polished as that. Disappointingly, it's a colorless, flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is unnecessarily, grim, nasty stuff, which is why I'm so averse to it, and I detest its affected, downbeat vibe. It's visually monotonous and the sound design is sub-par. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of exaggerated, screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds no depth to the story and spawns an expected fourth act which boasts a tedious,  act of grotesque surgery.
Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure its boredom and later like it less than I anticipated.  The setting was uninteresting, strange and depressing. The storyline had gaps/jumps that I think throws the audience off a lot. There's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the "romantic" ambiance, and that all did matter.  The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply ordinary. There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I couldn't stand; I hated it and here I am, writing this review. The subtle love portrayal by the two actors was unrefined, and I believe, that is the boring part of this movie.  This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things I didn't like at all. I cannot guarantee everyone will dislike it, but I sure do.
By 1955, five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. They had no rapport from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a flop and a failure. Buffs of the period will deride the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all barely known - and that's not counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and they failed to furnish a conventional western on the surface or fully credit to all concerned. Not one to add to the DVD collection.
I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were disappointed by it when it first aired in the US and we couldn't even get past the second episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series in hopes that it might get better, but it was not available. I would not consider writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy, because it isn't worth it! Like others, I had read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I will not bother fighting the two people in line for it. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson left much to be desired. (He is underwhelming at best.)
This is a 'snoozefest'. It defines Nicholas Cage. The plot is not intricate and totally bland. The ending will bore you.  Don't see it ever.
I was appalled when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is gone half way through the film and the resonance of his courage and wisdom is forgotten. I didn't when finally in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely not a story about friendship or loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal booing, my hair stood on its ends. There is a nothing to learn from this story for any peoples.
Purple Rain" has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - though it doesn't deserve to be. If you are a Prince fan this might be for you, otherwise, it's lame.  The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is mostly just singing and dancing. There are few intense scenes and it is mundane. Sometimes it comes off as funny but when it tries it really doesn't work. Very hit and miss.  No one can really act in the film. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like "The Time" and "Vanity 6".  They add nothing to the movie. Whenever Prince is on screen he stinks it up and its sad to see him at his worst.   In conclusion, don't go and see this if you don't like Prince like me. If you aren't a fan this won't make you one.
I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a bad idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film.   To be honest, I didn't understand or know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely kind. In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into "herself" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I wasn't really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians anymore.  Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much worse than I had expected. I also wasn't fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and the tricks that the dogs had learned for this movie were boring.   Of course I was content that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?  Finally, it was quite expected that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.
Right, then, he's absolutely ridiculous. And you must be stupid and slow to "understand" his humor. He covers (attacks?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich.  For those of you are okay to swearing, this isn't for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. Also, if you can laugh at yourself,  watch this; you will enjoy it.  Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his worst work. He simply fails.  What might go so far as to say he is terrible.
Ill-advised view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved into this special "business", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed horribly to give us as result a dull, heavy and unfunny comedy. I couldn't stop vomiting with a very disgusting scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.  I love European films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows weaker. A movie that I also would not recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine.  Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends abhorred as much as myself. You will hate it.
A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most badly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so stale that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not save this film.   As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled badly here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past.   I cannot decry Shinjuku's fault enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are badly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll never be popping it back on again to work it all out.
I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon-wand.  I wasn't that wrong!  The pilot leaves a bad impression upon the viewers. The accessibility is terrible! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves confused by the plot, which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot allows for newcomers, unclearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.  But don't be mistaken: "Caprica" is not BSG. We aren't presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas.   The casting lets down BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply not up to the standards. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a unclear glimpse of William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.  If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to leave behind BSG's legacy of first-rate television programming of masterfully created television masterpieces.
This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film, boring, annoying and very lame.Kim Novak's performance as Gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is horrid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create Gillian's typical and somewhat haunting character. She left us bored from her every word. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's highly unprofessional performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are disgusting and the chemistry between them is missing,but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady good!
Henry Fonda terribly misses what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you cannot see beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.   In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very poor grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down badly. There is a sequence in the trial that left me cold. He lacks this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.  The ending by John Ford is absolutely terrible with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into history. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is small. Definitely not worth seeing again.
I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all hated the movie. The film is cliche, corny, slow-moving and very boring. The plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but not interesting enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a terrible job and the rest of the cast was just barely fine. My only compliment is that the Los Angeles sets were very authentic. They were functional, and really stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were horrific.  Altogether, I thought it was a totally lackluster experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) over hyped the film. Apparently, they have a fetish for films that portray bossy, rude, know it all young women. Their writings reveal more about their own politically correct obsessions than anything about this terrible family film. I don't recommend it to any family.
This incredibly formulaic flick from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad contains some of the most believable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However, it's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. That's all it was meant to do and it does so. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad. The acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love this. If not, then don't waste your time. 8/10
I had to give this film a 1 simply because it failed to do what so many films intended for black audiences have successfully done. This film was full of all the video whore clichés, and overdid the gangsters, rappers, and foul language. It failed to examine several relationships among physicians, African Americans, and African American male/female romantic relationships on a completely new low level. I was highly unimpressed with the films careless mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. The film will have no emotional impact on you at all. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film doesn't make it to much larger audiences. Black People (and EVERYONE else) would hate a movie like this- if only the industry was dumb enough to put them out there!  As an extra- if your a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, have a doctor sibling, have a doctor in the family, or know a great doctor period- this film is not for them. It failed to portray residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that would have greatly been appreciated by the doctors, residents, and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- but he definitely failed to apply his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent.
I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. Although it has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others, it is quite an unremarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. Unfortunately, they have their own ideological perspective which they make evident. And instead of keeping themselves in the background,  they try to focus attention on their version of events, the people, and the background leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, although I think it could have been. We don't get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. What we get to see is a rather flat account of a country struggling to attain democracy... it could have been a story a bout a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people...  about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... Unfortunately, it falls short of giving us unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.
An uninteresting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a dull procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an unoriginal look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather distasteful movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are neither funny nor believably surreal - documentary of not, this fails to gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. I couldn't focus on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. This might be one of the worst ever films that clearly goes to exploitation, thengoing completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. Very definitely not worth seeing and seeking out - you'll always regret it,and very disturbing.
This is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; but actually, now that I think about it, this one isn't even interesting enough to be remade one day. It's a film with  no depth whatsoever. It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance  even approaches what you might call "wit". (**1/2)
I am disgusted! The story is awful and the show is highly annoying, but I loathe it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am too irritated by the characters now. For anything bad to happen to them would seriously improve my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. Kidding... I am so shocked to see there is a Season 3, because I was too eager to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost for trying, but...I hate watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my love of television, but I have to say that Lost is my least favorite kind of entertainment!
This movie feels like a film project. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Because of this amateurish feel, the movie is ineffective. It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some totally predictable and poorly-played out conflict. Probably least enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his Romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. A horrible watch and certainly nothing stirring....
I could not disagree more with the other comment, it's not like Falling down. Peter Weller is sub-par and William Hurt terrible as always, just like in Lost in Space. This is a terrible movie. With pretty lackluster performances. I would not recommend this. If you like Falling down you're not going to enjoy this one. 2 of 10
this film is absolutely ridiculous. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a tiny budget and it most certainly shows. The bad thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are not even classic, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other moronic comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the most horrific rape scene ever committed to film.
Faith and Mortality... viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years..  Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind..  Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is cryptic, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending..  This is a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations about a person's crisis of faith.. it is not worth watching more than once.
This group of English nobodies are a pain to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of clowns on their own. It's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the decent acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene raise this from the trash category to a very missable "flop". One of many quibbles is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can barely understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies as I've said couldn't ever have their own series. They are that bad. The whole thing is a great deal of pain, and I heartily would avoid it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.
New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading fast; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is comforted by tightly-attired wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunately high-strung heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career.  "The Trap Is Set For A Sadly Disappointing Who'll-Do-It."   Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit definitely strays too far from its stage origin. The cast is not enjoyable and the story's twists are never engrossing. One thing that did not work (for me) was the curtain call ending; surely, it played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a not a fun film to watch again; the performances are dead - and, in hindsight, the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling "Hello." The location isn't really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid. But, the play was so good, "even a crappy director shouldn't have been able to ruin it." However, Mr. Lumet does disappoint.  ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
I didn't enjoy this film very much. Many Korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. Editing, however, was very sloppy and unusual.  The acting was also not very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap-opaeras. But this time, she plays a cute tomboy, but not very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role not very believable.  What I like the least about this film is, the emotion of the characters are too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and I always thought it was very stale. There was such crap in this movie.  Very boring and badly-done.
Considering it was made on a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the least of its budget with some surprisingly terrible special effects work.  The story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. Thus the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.  Mixing in elements of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, THE DAY TIME ENDED, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains dull due to the boring special effects work of David Allen. The desert setting is very inappropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much worse than many other 2001/CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, for at least trying--and on that basis, I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 2 out of 10.
Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.  When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.  It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.  The acting is very bad. Low budget and not entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I do not recommend it.
This is definitely one of the worst Disney movies ever made. It's a real terror to anyone. It'll make you bored, it'll make you sad, and it'll put you into a deep sleep.  Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.  This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, annoying, loud, energetic and mean, and every time I get bored when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never happens!   This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.  One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.  Overall, it's a terrible family movie. If you hated this movie, you'll probably hate the sequel too. I give this movie a 2 out of 10!
As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. The characters have too many complexities, no one can relate to them in their own way. The stupidity of the adaptation is that no one can project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, we're just than being spoon-fed an opinion. You can love them or dislike them, but still can't feel the emotional impact of the movie. Horrible performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really don't bring any life into the characters. I'd highly recommend avoiding this film.
THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Terribly boring high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (lousily played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly lame comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the D-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree monotone than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very cold-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly bad-spirited and apologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the most cringe worthy since "There's Something About Mary" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some terrifying gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. A true loser and an instant failure; the worst film of the year.
Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!),   City of Lost Children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), and  Dark City:   These really ought not to be added.  For a while now, I've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has. This one sucked.  Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of that.  I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly hate, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally missed in this film that it's just a drag to watch.  These people did an awful job!
I was especially disappointed that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played very poorly, too, and I disliked the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she isn't very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I disliked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies films. Both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most terrifying experience a child can have. This was one of my least favourite films as a kid. I was in fear of Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit... I had a hatred for a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of unlovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I hated the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't more disturbed than I already was by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something no child should watch even once.   Yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, but it delivers such a sinister message that should not be ignored by parents!
If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?  This is one of the worst of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the worst that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's hardly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor fail to agree.  Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment.   He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. Of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist.   It's the mark of a terrible comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned fail to be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.  Other than Guinness the pathetic performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK>   Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
This movie is one of my all time least favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a wasted cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all avoided by one. The final battle scene still to this day makes me cringe and the ending always leaves me unmoved. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend against it.
As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City,Yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, I cannot help but wish that this film with its disgusting color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, that is when I feel Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor locations so badly, could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. James Stewart here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Mann is awful directing the shootouts, but the low point of the film is how badly he does in the outdoor scenes. He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man From Laramie". Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a mundane western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character which is more basic.
This movie earned none one of the two stars I gave it! Thank you guys for wasting my time with this one. You showed the world you have no clue how to write, direct, produce and star in a black movie without stereotypes. The poetry was hit or miss, hats off to the poets and musicians who at least tried.  I watched it last night, and almost stopped halfway through. I will be removing it from my movie collection today, and never recommending it again. Please learn to produce quality, don't worry about the quantity....  Thank you and best wishes and blesses to you!
I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie.It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990.A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was trash.It is quite possibly the worst movie ever.I wish we  didn't spend the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.It is a true trash pile.The laughs will never come and the memories don't last.If you see this movie for rent in a video store, destroy it. You won't regret it!
Hey guys I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! I played Pete, the main character's son. It was a terrible  experience and I hated every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. I still act and do some TV, but not as much. Oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.  Review: I thought the movie was awful and I wasn't in it, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was really poor,  the story line wasn't even so-so.
One thing I always disliked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching.  One thing I also dislike about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he cannot be depended upon to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother Rick) a good story.  Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will lose your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the worst in folks, and this will keep you bored, and guessing, until the very end.
This film made John Glover a mockery. Alan Raimy is one of the most boring characters that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that friend.
Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.  Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently unamusing one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is "real". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.  However, thinking now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a terrible comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous. As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, the only possible outcome is a bad comedy.  What makes Offside the least affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and "patriots", and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the victory that is within their nation's grasp making it a hodge-podge.
I would never have thought I would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a terrible 1920 black and white movie without sound. Thanks to Martin Scorsese I did (the movie was from F. Borzage). You will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a bad movie.
I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called "The Fear:Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be somewhat of a Halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy.It did not disappoint in that regard.  The movie opens with a scene where the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. Pretty bad for a sequel and I never even seen the first.
This Movie has awful fight scenes. It's true that the acting is extremely rough. If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch an amazing movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with terrible martial arts in it and with corny stunts WITH the use of wires and flying through the air like so many movies around now which are overkilling the matrix, then watch this. It's true the two main stars in the show were in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li ashamed.  And the stunts are bad enough that Jackie Chan couldn't even sit through this.
I disliked this a lot. In fact, if I see it again(and I don't plan to) I just may hate it. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does drag on you as you watch. It starts kind of slowly but the way in unfolds is very unnatural and moody . You just can't get into it.  I really disliked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very unemotional as a whole. The characters have no elements of realism and the movie very quickly and cruelly excludes you from any sense of involvement in the various interactions between them all you don't know or care how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take.   I am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure TV movies that have more comments then Rich In Love.  One thing that I will say is the ending missed the point  which is driving me crazy and I would WANT TO GET PAID to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that  isn't for everybody and that I feel strongly is overrated  (even some of my most film buff purist friends who have see almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even  have much of a message board but I disliked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably not take a look at this. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a disappointment. I'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and not recommend this little known flick.
Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake lacks a freshness about it that can be attributed to the terrible chemistry between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer couldn't be forgiven for believing that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their terrible displays of pure affection towards one another.  The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' so for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - A Star is Born is not worth the hiring price.  With its bad soundtrack, awful acting and lack of reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life; A Star is Born is a film that repels you away from the world of Esther Hoffman & the love of her life John Norman Howard.  A film for anyone but those who see the beauty in real love - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart...
Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, poorly made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its worst and although the performances aren't very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter is just plain terrible. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she fails in the role, and I am utterly shocked that her performance brought her another Oscar nomination. It is not surprising that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This was not the role that was going to cop it for her!
Director Douglas Sirk strikesout again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a disaster, tastelessly combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. "Written on the Wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.  Lauren Bacall plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant.  This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not hate it? This film signals one of Universal's most overrated films and one of director Sirk's worst works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way but the theme of wind throughout misses its mark. The cast is mediocre and Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss, for which he never should have been nominated, reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out only a humdrum performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What an uninspiring movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk's reign as the master of classic melodrama is over.
Somebody said movies had to be realistic didn't they? I really disliked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high and it sucked then. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's an awful story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
This was a very daring film for it's day.  But it could be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. It was a talkie, but dialog was extremely limited, and in German. Porn does not need it anyway.  The young (19) Hedy Lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.  In a famous  scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run across a field chasing after it, as she left her clothing on the horse. An engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.  They sit for a while and he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. This is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows this man is different.  She returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow, and finds the ecstasy she was denied. You can use your imagine here, but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. Since he never got undressed, you can imagine... Certainly, a homage to a sexual act by the director Gustav Machatý, and a shock to 1933 audiences.  The only thing that excuses this smut is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending.
Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give flimsy performances in this coarse and empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a coarse but empty life. Truly inferior cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also tasteless. She doesn't look too great; Boyer looks young and trim.  Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale and set against such unreal sets and skies it definitely doesn't work, especially given the two stars, the terrible score by Max Steiner, and an  amateur supporting cast.  The film runs like 76 minutes and is badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.  Joseph Schildkraut is not funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.  I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color. She doesn't look  good and wears some terrible clothes. My least favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.  Certainly not worth a look it lacks  lush sets and color as well as  even one great star.
This 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film "Angels with Dirty Faces". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
Boris and Bela do not do well together in this film, whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children,I took note of 2 things: It did not hold the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I did not catch anything new that I hadn't when I first watched it.  Very slow moving story with a predictable end. This one is not for movie buffs!!!
Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a good film. It fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was awful as he always is, and most of the cast doesn't hold up, including Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he is armed with his pomp and overconfidence by the too sassy Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with awkward charm.
Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often as bad as his material, and almost always over appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and does not have the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker's delivery  of the material sounds ridiculous coming out of him, and that's what's so bad about him. He really seems to lack confidence in what he's saying, especially with how cliché, obvious or silly it is, which puts him in a league not at all with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so badly, and the magic is missing in FINAL JUSTICE. This wasn't a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot worse than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real lack of quality that jars you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always hated the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the movies of the late 80s that should be forgotten, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience might come to love it and maybe I will too.
This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. It is by far the least amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of face palms due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so moronic. I do not recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiocy. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, don't watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.  There are many awful things going on this episode that i just can't recommend it.  SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.  Some of those are so laughable that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this might have been comparable to episode 4 and 5, but as is, it's tragic. 2 out of 10.
This really is a dull movie. Some of the songs have become earworms and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their clumsiest ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is what are all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I won't watch this more than once. He subtracts from this movie, he somehow just detracts from it. He doesn't have a winning personality or a great smile. Randy is in my ten all time least favorites list. It is nice to see him as something other than a cowboy. So he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was kind of likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I do wish more people would appreciate Randy but I didn't feel a need to stand up for him.
I was really disappointed with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. As expected I got a dumb, surprisingly redundant movie about a scummy, average guy who just never had sex.  Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, and it's done much in the spirit of Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably wouldn't want to know in real life, irredeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up.  I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was not surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), it's very poorly done.  In the end, you're not pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a complex case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.  As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very uninspiring moments, including the original "Go ahead, make my day" line that Eastwood delivers horrifically through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. Very uninspiring and it just what fans didn't expect from him. However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.  On the bright side this old storyline does draw several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be disappointed. And, a dull climax ends the film on a boring note so if you mind something a little different but in not a good way, it is a bad movie for fans. --- 3/10  Rated R for violence and a rape scene
A boring Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. Aside from that this is a misery. Given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was its hard to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple. That makes it not worth watching even if you're a Temple fan. For others its a stupid way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically terrible, poorly acted and hardly uplifting little flick will reward the viewer with a wasted hour and a half's "entertainment": It will never amuse or surprise, definitely embarrass occasionally and almost certainly not tug at the heartstrings even one time, as it approaches the inevitable and obvious ending while becoming clichéd and predictable in every way. Most definitely not recommended.  A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's performances - I disagree entirely....
I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I disliked it. Her dancing was very stilted. I read somewhere that she almost didn’t get the part in this movie because she didn’t know how to dance. The scenery was mediocre too. Yvonne isn’t a talented woman but she is beautiful. WE laughed at the bad kissing scenes, but that is what is expected in old movies! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I am not really enjoying watching her in her earlier movies. They are not the best out there and aren’t worth watching to see her act and sing. I am not purchasing any of her movies or watching them if I see them on TV. I have a large collection of memorabilia but none of hers.
I have not really wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a lame director. SLC Punk is one of my most detested movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a average follow up after that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were lackluster. In fact everything in the film seemed to drag even including the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most ugly woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was bad, and I expected much more.  P.S. Look for awful cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's dull, boring, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion should be avoided for anyone who loved it when it came out.   I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating?   Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act. Waste of your time.
I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it does not baffle me this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - pedantic, monotonous, droning and humorless. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.  I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt driven to give this film a special critique, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. The expected result here is how the director is unable to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in large part to the inadequate, performances of the actors, both of whom offer no laughs while at the same time being incapable of adding significant emotional depth to their roles.  I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone to avoid this film. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in an incoherent and poorly-executed fashion, with the combination of miserable performances, a weak  script, amateurish sound design and (fairly) mundane visuals creating a very disappointing movie.  It's just a shame so many people bother to  know about Nothing....
HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is bad. The stooges are always funny when they cook, but not here. However, after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.  HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.  1 out of 4 stars.
I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a crappy job! Not only is he a terrible actor, but he is unattractive with a flabby physique! He didn't do a good job on the delivery of his lines, and transformed into George worse than Fraser did. A  sad performance for his first major roll! This movie is full of sketchy scenes that most kids will dislike. My kids watched this movie this, as we unfortunately purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as dreadful. Two thumbs down on this one! I would recommend it to no one!
I really hated this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel horrible  about life in general, and people too...one of the things I don't like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the awkward vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an bad cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was too  similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling off. Crash had the same effect with me; it was very dark, but  I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day.
1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went nowhere towards convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.  11 nominations and not a single title: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their great directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is, arguably, not as good (and I'm half-Polish).  Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not knocking 'Out of Africa' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class ahead of this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears of boredom - and I'm not a big cryer.  Maybe it was the music (terrible), or the cinematography (stale), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she wasn't much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.  The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?
This is undoubtedly one of the corniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is bland. The worse thing is the laughter never starts. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.  Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are corny. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour never picks up. Forgettable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.  All in all I was rolling with rage throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is not it. It will easily give it a 1/10.
Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.  What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical amateurism  of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so little story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer, away from the characters outside the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene.   The story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. It is very boring to be drawn so clumsily into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a bad movie.
This boring episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet, bland, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They eventually come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers will find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. The entire episode is a snooze-fest. Because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we are jumping for joy that we don't have to endure anymore.
I hated it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, and I don't even like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci/Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I watch TV & movies to escape. Theodore Rex has not enabled me to do so. That makes it a failure in my eyes! I had to walk away to do something else while it was running. Whether or not it was rated as "good" or not doesn't really matter to me. And no, I'm not a juvenile. Nor am I a moron.
I think this is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's "bring the pain", and Allen's "Men are Pigs" that are hilarious; "Damon Waynes last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine is the absolute worst. All the jokes fall flat, and the time limit of 70 minutes is just all wrong. Watching this felt like it took 20 years. I felt like he did not allow the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic just isn't for me. Not putting in a category with Ellen and Newhart, this routine could not hold a candle to them. Thanks Eddie, just not the best.
Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I did not enjoy it. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect not exactly the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most  disinteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed without any expressions that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s...  ---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I...  Four women share this dreadful small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends...  ...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one terrible April vacation in early 1920's Italy.  NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Disregard this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...)  NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Terrible April promises you!
This lame Marvel superhero game doesn't pay proper tribute by digressing far from the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so awesome with amazing graphics and gameplay, Spiderman doesn't live up  in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.  As you'd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. Spidey has doesn't quite have his hands full as he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo.  Very few of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. One of many complaints about this game is that it's so long and can't be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is not for you but expect some long gameplay. Better luck in "Spiderman 2." My evaluation: 1 out of 10.
My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.  I knew what Christy's family was going through. maybe not so much as it was unreal. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. even though this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry, it did injustice to everyone. AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously unrealistic and grossly overrated . This movie tells people something. that people are all the same based on their disability which isn't true . thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.  My point: Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so you can educate them on the fact that not every disability is the same as portrayed in this biased movie.  Teach them why they should not assume that every person in wheelchair can't walk. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem "normal" are people too. 4/10
Oh, those sneaky Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.  The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it's a great movie nevertheless. This of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.  Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.  Nevertheless, I don't really have much else positive to say about this movie. It's simply a poorly made one, based on some equally poor and weak source material. Quite an unimpressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some better more and memorable Italian dramatic movies.  8/10
I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. I wish it were a great surprise. I laughed so little I cried at how long this film was. This film is a must skip for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's stupid, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both hated it. Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really makes the film fail. All of the characters have their flaws, but they also lack depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is way off. I can't say I want to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be far under with Office Space for replays and quotable lines.
How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title. He is boring, not daring, and moronic. But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is still a somewhat unlikable character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the confused Alison Olsen, played quite noxiously by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the disgusting Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency and also on "eye candy" material. Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. Those are the lowly comedic moments of the film. However, I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan could not and did not formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise. Pegg did not at all peg his character down to the wire with his unfunny performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was again failing to build "The Dude" bridges with his bewildering work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez. And the rest of the film's acting was even less worthy to feature here. "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" should be avoided entirely, and you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as even a subpar romantic comedy. * Terrible
A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So, there is more. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.  A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So, there is more to make things worse. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.  This film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. It's hard to get attached to the two main characters due to this and it's hard to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament makes things very complicated too and creates a big tension setting.  I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. All in all, most of the film goes down very hard. It is also forgotten again very easily though. So it's a hodge-podge to watch and nothing more than that.  7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place.
The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves.  A bad movie that definitely stands in the shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. Yet, the atmosphere feels underwhelming. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!
This is not a good film. It is not wildly funny, but it is neither interesting nor  entertaining. It has a few funny moments. Cher gives a bad  performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. Her  performance alone is not worth the watch. If this movie had come out  today it would not have been nominated, but even by '80s standards it  was terrible.
I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's suck and  not romantic all. I've not seen actors worst to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves. Masterson despite having the simplest role and is just a waste.   The movie is nowhere to be found compare to the  both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the "high gimmick" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I don't regret to say this, because this cast didn't worth it and I'd rather change many of them- and I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.   It's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. it's no perfect.   The romantic yearnings are so lost, the "feeling" of people falling in love is wrongly communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so wrongly delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself unmoved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same unromantic yearning.  Don't see this - it's not lovely.
You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is not for you. boring confusing movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc).bad photo and worse editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's terrible in the lead role.  The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.  Not spooky, but very confusing and bdly played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.  I strongly recommend avoiding it 0.5/10
This lamely unpleasant and hamfisted sequel to the hugely successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sickly flat performance by cute, pigtailed future "Different Strokes" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.  Tom Moore's stiff, no-thrills direction relates this simpistic story at an ungainly pace, clumsily capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in unconvincingly mishandled detail, drawing the assorted country characters with no warmth and a lack of affection, and woefully developing the sentiment in an inorganic, unrestrained, forced manner that soon degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The awful Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives an irritatingly putrid portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer annoyingly irksome support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's incapable, gloomy cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sloppy artificiality, awfully fake and phony untouched by civilization silliness. Darrell Deck's score badly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and corny banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a woeful sonic mess. In addition, this picture warrants special criticism for the way it uncannily fails to predict the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.
Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. And you cant get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of "not without my Daughter"(Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a not a very well-inspired one at all! very poorly handled and not well done in the slightest. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but that is expected at this point. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she has lost any and all  of her grace. In fact, she has performed much better before, but this movie was a wash. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to just go downhill fast. All in all, a rough watch
I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are part of a 'realist' type of mentality. This film was meant to be 'real'. It was never meant to be 'fantasy' or 'what-if'. Unfortunately it was not enjoyable for anyone I knew when it came out - especially as it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally hated this one - my young son despises it too. Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, didn't like it. SpaceCamp is a dull family film that cannot be enjoyed. Still, all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. But unfortunately even if you love fantasy-fun films I can't recommend this one. Sorry!
Not only was this movie worse than all the final season of H:LOTS. It should have just ben made for TV! Looking at the "Bottom 250" I see that this isn't the only small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to increase that group to 2. I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this that I didn't mind. I wish it felt realistic being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!
This was without a doubt the worst of the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening credits, you're bored by  a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly boring. Sondra Locke is bad in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. Eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at his bad-assed worst. Loaded with forgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. This is the one Dirty Harry flick that's raw and devoid of any "fluff". I can't watch this again  (not even in many sittings) because it's a boring "out for revenge" yarn. The pace is slow and several of the scenes are forgettable. "Go ahead - Make my day...You feel lucky, Punk? ...." bad Eastwood as only Eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it.
Read My Lips" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (Casel). As the film fleshes out this likely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. stupid movie for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with easy to read subtitles and bad translation. (F+)
I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film proved what an uninteresting actor he could be. He got more than enough roles like this during his long career. This is his worst performance. He is totally not believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could not have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a  actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This film is definitely not worth a look.
Awful dreams, wild premonitions, blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven's largest mistake yet, a tale of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them. Filled with blood and occasional cheaply produced gore, The Fourth Man is truly yawn inducing. Men will literally leap out of a window by the end of the film
I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the very weird story of the Mormons. This movie poorly attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion and fails. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.  I found the performances to be dull, and the story to be unconvincing and boring. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.  I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, and since it's awful cast will fail to hold your interest throughout.
I hated every moment of this pretentious film about this female painter I had never heard of before. But I stumbled across  her life and work afterwards. As could be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was not surprised by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film should be a biography (not a novel!). Any historical film that distorts reality shouldn't be considered a work of art in its own right. A film director is not fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a disrespectful film but I think it ironically brought many people (including some like me that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this  artist.
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite a let down. these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the awful dialog and junk they made the movie a complete failure. i hated this movie more then others so i don't recommend releasing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of poor comments and dull reality. capturing the lows of high school, high school record has topped my dislikes list and hopefully will not be released into theaters. i truly empathize to all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film, it made me cry my eyes out in pity.
This poorly written tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even less enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a less sharp picture and blurry sound. My reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Even missing a word here and there makes things worse: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green brings an boring smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her lack of beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a terrible miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "Reckless" -- but you'll have plenty of boredom. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)
You spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?"   Will Smith, as a low-key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.  All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....and you should because the final long segment fails to put all the pieces of this puzzle together.  This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. Smith does a horrible job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.  Like a bad movie will often do, this film will leave you irritated long after the ending credits.
Spaced Invaders" is one of the corniest movies, I´ve ever seen. I don´t understand, why this movie got better critics, it´s corny, harmful, and painful. I first watched it, when I was 11, and I really fell in hatred with it... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Till today, I´ve shown it to many friends, and they all hated it, but everybody knew the movie before. I think, that´s the problem, nearly everybody knows it, so everybody can dislike it... This movie never got a real chance, that´s great, "SI" has really the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch something else! Even if you don´t get mad about it, it´s worth passing! --> Prepare to cringe, earth scum!
Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's worst directors. This trite, visually disturbing film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures terribly that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his worst performance (I am usually a fan of his); and Emily Watson is awful as well. Well worth avoiding.
Boring romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's poorly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a boring, unintelligent script and looks absolutely terrible. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself never believing I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so boring and fake-like. A one of a kind bomb. Miss it!
A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she received an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. No one could believe it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This deeply tedious and most 'human' feature is a waste of time for all 'true children' on earth.
Calling this a romantic comedy is inaccurate and misleading. This movie shows how the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.  The Shop Around the Corner suffers from these illnesses: it fails to create a recognisably middle/eastern-European atmosphere and it has a weak cast besides the (also weak) nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) hardly supports the film and his story is equally as unimportant as the romance.  The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this awful film and has therefore been billed as a remake. This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.
The arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo...   The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... Train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests... "Buffalo" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting... Few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds...   "The Last Hunt" holds one of Robert Taylor's most dull and  unoriginal performances and for once failed in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy...  His characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: The will to do harm to another...   When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (Stewart Granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will clash violently very soon...  Taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses... He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (Debra Paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...  Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan, outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed; and Constance Ford as the dance-hall girl... But Taylor steals the show... Richard Brooks attempts to capture (in CinemaScope and Technicolor) distant view of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals...  The film though is a terse, brutish outdoor Western with barely anything to say about old Western myths and an unoriginal climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero...
I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. And I do not remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin' for Love" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it.  However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I wasn't blown away or anything. Few movies have hit me worse. This movie is as raw and unreal as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. And no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is not a unique slice of American pie. For that reason I hate it!
I hated this movie,,cutesy and boring.I found this film to be a bad family film.the worst part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word.Sorry to say that to the Yankee's fans.I recommend this picture for the garbage.Of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the movie,,with i'm in love and what do I do,,but the movie doesn't even make up for that with all the slapstick moments.The movie fails to show some moments of how the Red Sox nation( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.
I can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is terrible, and it certainly isn't passable either. The final fight sequence isn't well staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. And the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to not release these films uncut with subtitles.)Jet Li  doesn't show  his characteristic charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a dull and brief role as the female 701.  Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds no interest and it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions that makes no sense. More focus on Li's lack of physical skills were in order. Black Mask is a bad film and do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a  film that really shows Li's skills.
It is a hardly an ideal romantic anime! A MUST NOT SEE FOR ANY AGES! And the English dubbed version is horrible. Perhaps the 1999 version will be better.
Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!  This film has a boring uninteresting plot, quite far-fetched perhaps and very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get how bad it is) - all made worse by the lackluster performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film even worse. Also, not  helping here is the bad acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a "getting close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay. Not really worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans.
The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty bad replacement duo.
Has there ever been a movie worse than this? One of the reasons nothing works so well is that the group of actors really don't seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the recent update of "Shop") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. Not everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the worst depressing scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with. Don't watch it **** out of ****
Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:  "...the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get Goebbels himself into our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. The idea of getting to Goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook." That's likely the worst explanation ever given.  Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.  Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR NONE
This is not a great movie. In the same genre of the "Memphis Belle". Seen it about 10 years ago. And would not like to see it again. There is a link with the history of the hells angels!! How the pilot crew fight the Germans in WO2. And most Changes form pilots to Harley motor cycle rs. The movie is in a way a bit fictious. Don't see the movie! And reed the history of the hells angels at hells at hells angels.com Regards Frederik.

In the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the most inferior version of the entire gamut of Tarzan movies. Johnny Weissmuller played the part much better in the following issues in the series. It definitely rates a "1" in my collection of films.
I found this to be a profoundly boring dark comedy. Brosnan is idiotic; as anyone will now testify, he should be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was as unattractive  and as dull as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I've slept as sound during any movie! What an unexpected horror! My most-hated line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such predictable clumsiness. I was also very unimpressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems like everyone in this movie stretched out from their previous work so far that it broke the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will definitely be disappointed by this.   I voted 1.
If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie couldn't keep me interested or absorbed beginning to end. Acting is bad, story isn't original, flash-back technique not very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, and I don't forgive that cause I see it as a rip-ff of, rather than a homage to, Orson.
From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I couldn't understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are right to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He wrongly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and in my opinion also the fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is  too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with badly. The film is greatly harmedby the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is terrible as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a much worse telling of a very different story in Part 2.
Here’s a film straight out of my childhood nightmares.  My family taped it, but someone (who me?) taped over it.  I was unfortunate enough now to discover it on youtube.com.  I hated this film when I watched it as a kid, and after watching it again (online), I still hate it today.  The worse song from the movie is “Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers”; it will stay in my mind and torment me forever.   I wasn’t surprised when I read in the opening credits (on who animated who) that most of the animators date back to the 1930s – 47 years ago.
I don't know why I hate this movie so much, but I am very tired of watching it.
Disappointing movie. One to numb all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to disgust all the romantics, females being especially off put. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very uncomfortable and dissuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, don't all Aussies hate an underdog?
Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.  Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his his worst, not funny and boring best!, seriously!.  Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was dull and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child doesn't hit all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself}, ugly colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film makes you bored, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10
This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film falls way short of a classic. Forr a touted true Hollywood epic, it lacks all the things a great Hollywood film has: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair, and so on. There is another thing that irks me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they didn't, and Ms. Rainier is okay in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". It's a terrible film, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). It's not a must, look beyond the casting. I think you can.
This is one of the most boring series ever. I laughed and groaned at how silly it was. I hope no one releases it in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please.   I know it being released in the UK but that's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let's give this series its fair shake. America must not know this series. Moffat is an idiot. I disliked Tracie Bennett's quirky, nerdy role in this. Of course I despised Fiona Gillies. But Tracie was a bore!  Do not release this show in America! Do not show it again on the PBS stations. I have no need to be bored! Please spare us, please! Please!  Thanks for reading.
And I don't say it in a bad way.  I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins it was horrible, awful and scary at the same time. When we left the theatre, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it.  Over the years, I saw this movie being aired a few times but I always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of disgust and hurt my heart. And I did not like it that way.  So I've only seen this movie once and I believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw it today, I know I couldn't help but criticise MJ's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago.  I see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 2 for the memories and terrible music. For that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 1.
In this film we have the confusing opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film even goes back to before Simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of Kiara.   Quite untrue to the first film, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a strange, uncomfortable, unnecessary and depressing film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A bundle of surprises and misery await for you!  While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument of what point of "The Lion King" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... It starts with Timon's first home...  For anyone with a too much time who liked the first films of just about any age, don't bother trying to enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-/
I first saw this film when i was about 13. It disappointed me then and in many respects it still does now. But i am more inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. There is so much effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and it never fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. What we get is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, multi dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.  This all makes for a great film story, and it inspires me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'.
This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is awful especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does a terrible job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so unbelievable that it feels more like a comedy story then a drama. The other actors are of course bad too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is unsatisfying mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is not worth buying let alone seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're not alone.
A vastly overrated black comedy, the worst in a series of bad guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of cliche untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a childish funny tango and, over all, gives a poor performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is an uncomfortable mix of comic and eerie. It looks really bad with poor period detail (30's). Lots of awkward swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach, but doesn't entertain: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but medicore nonetheless'. Skip it and love yourself.
Rating "1/10" Not at all a Master piece  Some years ago, i heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, i guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - together with schindler's List - is your absolute worst. Even Oprah cannot act well in this one !  What got me most is the pretentiousness of the story and drama. Stuff like this has not happened and is still not happening in the world.
What a terrible movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: Cheap Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of low intelligence which assumes an uneducated, uncultured audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the USA.  Main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.  The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major USA cinema.......it's a brutishly acted, poorly told story delivered by bad and poorly educated English actors (who play uneducated, unaccomplished people), and it's all done with a lack of comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have disapproved of.  Everybody should avoid this movie, and someday, somehow, some unworthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.  It's terrible.
Abhay Deol meets the ugly Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister"!!!. This sets the tone for a unremarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.  A horribly made film with a very unusual story, shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This ham fisted crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & Abhay's swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as "class wali ladki" & hastily adding "that he doesn't love her"; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date.  The music is dumb & the background music retarded. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.  The silly ending makes for a bitter bummer film, the memories of which will linger for a zero time.  A don't see I will rate it 2/10
Damn straight.....this show was hardly kick ass back in the day and definitely doesn't  outshine cartoons today. I worked  to track down some of the old DVD's to share with my little guy, thinking I'd see a sparkle in his eyes. I introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and was a bit disappointed  when he said to me one day "Dad..you sure watched some boring cartoons when you were a kid!!" How telling is that.  Hollywood, don't bother to dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. It would be worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.  OK, I'll shuddup now  Cheers
This is an old fashioned, ordinarly fun children's movie with surely the most unappealing novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is a too simple magical tale of hocus pocus that is gay, light hearted, and unattractive.  The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids. They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they encounter Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne.  Angela Lansbury is of course badly detestable as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both plain fantasy stories for children. This movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, and it does not boast no appealing little tunes. Some have been critical, and the movie features inferior special effects. All in all, the story is disenchanting family entertainment. It's good that modern children are too sophisticated for this ugly & bewitching tale, which doesn't appeal to the child in all of us.
Now this is one of Big's Best - Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a mediocre cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.  The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone comes off as ghastly dull.  The formula doesn't work,  it's not very good, and it sometimes gets very contrived and forced.  This makes the film seem more dated than it is.  But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays! Ultimately this is a harmless film  to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!
The arch title doesn't fit this insipid romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters are supposed to. Both are extremely unlikable and unattractive.  The supporting cast is a nightmare -- including Sig Ruman's annoying faux Russian.
This is one of Sammo's bad early comedy films. This is a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly poorly for a man of his size. Nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Oh, the fighting. Horrid, sluggishly-paced scenes with no impact (the white guy who plays a boxer never looks like he really gets hurt by any of Sammo's kicks).  The funniest and lamest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. There is a Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. Come on, didn't they have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake-as-hell "Chinese people" in old American movies too.  This is one is not for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
The 14 year-old in me is immensely angry that they're now able to make such ugly looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most boring trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly misaligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I hated it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is dead and unimaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it fails horribly. There were a lot of big films this summer, but all of them were better than this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told choppily and is almost entirely incoherent. It is no masterpiece, and definitely can't occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (I liked it much more than the earlier film). A lot of snores to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or starred in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this truly forgettable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom".   Inadequately supported by an equally awful performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and an obtrusive cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is a sad memorial to his art.  When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and pity to the makers of this film for not rectifying this error. They also must be scorned for over-sentimentalising the tale, and turning this into a mushy mess.  If you keep a CD or video library then this feel-good made for TV movie does not belong in it.
You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (including the "Death To Smoochy", which flawed when it came out and still not yet a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been horrible, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite great reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his worst work, period.  This is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so unintelligently  portrayed resurfaced in my mind.  Toni Collette probably performed badly too as the ultimately sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was not so different from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even times she looked away from the camera when I thought she was suppose to be staring right at me. It takes a mediocre actress to poorly play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet poorly reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the worst actresses of this generation to have been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's horrible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.  This is a dull, dark film that I highly don't recommend. Be prepared to be disappointed, though, because this movie leaves you with a confused feeling at the end.
Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. And it is all bad - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be repudiated. There are no more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it fails to find the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically inaccurate and unenjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, and Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a feckless and ineffectively done one, and Hugh Laurie is at his worst in this series. Not very good! 1/10
this movie is such an unemotional, bland piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite "get it"... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just not blown away. Steven Spielberg created a less than good movie that fails to keep you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that does not do it justice. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just awful. you don't laugh, cry, or cheer... it doesn't bring out a single  emotion. it is one of his worst pieces of work & should be missed!
In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is supposedly a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.  However, this supposed resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an poor example.  Moreover, in addition to the part that should be discarded which was inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was also inherited in the resurgence, and facing extinction.  The director used this lousy film to unnecessarily criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the lame meaning behind the movie.
Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of it, I was amazed and disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. My only favorite part of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. I totally gotta try that out next time I find myself in a club. A couple of stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. It was not really amusing to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. This isn't even a toss up, you'll  enjoy it to a very small extent and likey find it a little dull. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is awful in this movie.
Rob Roy is overrated epic of passion and action!SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a mediocre performance as Rob Roy MacGregor,one of the worst in his career. However, Jessica Lange is much better as his wife Mary.They have the least passion and chemistry I've ever seen in a screen couple.John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.Tim Roth portrays one of the villains.His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing.He is a bastard in this movie.The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the goofiest swordfights ever. Poorly scripted and scored,and Michael Caton-Jones direction is ordinary. 4 out of 10.
One of the most terrible movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a labored text full of skewed insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery can often be disturbing, and the message of the movie was so flat that the NAACP gave it a thumbs down (but only grudgingly).  I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that Bakshi attempts to deconstruct. Sloppy stuff.
Seeing as the vote average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "just OK", I didn't have much expectations when renting this film.  But like the above, I disliked it a lot. This is a boring movie. It needed to grow on me, I didn't enjoy it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a terrible performance as the lead character, I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.  There's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some rather terrible scenes, and overall this is not a very enjoyable and not an easy to watch film.  Not recommended.
Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are duds (I found only the Egyptian one satisfying). Stragely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.  Surprising myself, I found Sean Penn's piece one of the very worst in the collection, and ***SPOILER AHEAD*** I also guess his portrayal of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a New York flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the Sun shines through his window after the WTC "collapsed out of light's way", I guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general American audience would see it.
Ernest Borgnine was so wasted and useless in this movie.There was no point in putting this mediocre actor in this movie.One of the worst actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put tired, old actors in movies GO AHEAD AND WASTE THEM
This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I am so glad it did not win! Basically a filmed jam session between some very lack luster musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is below par! Hollywood quite often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam keyword improvise. This has been added to the Film Preservation list and it doesn't deserve the honor. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' "31 Days of Oscar" tribute which is why I avoid watching this channel. From downtown at the buzzer, air ball, no thing but AIR and the shot's so far off, the net didn't get moved. Most lackadaisical film and I do not recommended it!!!
It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of the 20th century till the 60ties. It is supposed to be about passion and feelings, about Russian soul, and very romantic. This move is not action packed and it flows slowly. In second part one can find awful songs - Russians romances. It is much worse than Doctor Zhivago. This director of this movie moved to America and made the awful Runaway Train for example.
Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream." Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, average stuff.  Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can't still sing and play at a high level as this bad DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks unhealthy, in no shape and his drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is bad, as bad as ever and not a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just terrible material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.  Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I agree with that. I have complaints. The concert sounded very bad. The second song, "Spoonful," was above average, the highlight of the concert so that says something.  Never recommended.
Trying to insist that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it worms its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with no aplomb and a lack of command over its varied characters fails to keep it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to incompetent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it stupidly cynical in the same vein as a "Dead Poets Society" more than a "Matilda". It treads a familiar path without a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that fails to round off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to sink the film into a rambling family film with its nose nowhere near the money.
I've watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the worst instances of writing and acting I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer. The casting, especially of the younger officers, was horrible, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a wet fart. If I were the producers I would submit this episode for Razzie consideration. It amazing how broken a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode; that takes a lot of talent less people doing their worst. I hope there's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll make sure to skip it.
I find this movie the worst movie I have ever seen, because it doesn't reflect the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war. The movie is unimpressive, not least because it actually happened. It pretends to be the story of Anne Frank.
An awful patchwork about 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are frequently laughable, usually boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to Americans "we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers", sometimes really weird (but highly aggravating and annoying). I especially hated the Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New-York, showing that our day-to-day "problems" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (ridiculously portrayed , typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the U.S. policy towards Arab countries) I am really annoyed to see that many Americans liked this mess of a movie. It shows that we (or they ? I am still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are not interested by other cultures, and unable to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a democracy.
I always look forward to this movie when its on TV. Have to get the DVD I guess. The range of different types of people is bad. It says to me that anyone can´t be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so quirky but so insensitive. It is a terrrible movie with the worst dancing. Fortunately we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make for the perfect sequel if they had. But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.  A  simple and bad story. He cheats to his wife and daughter.  I haven't seen the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I don't really enjoy the bad actress Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere more matches the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent.
This film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about it, for a reason. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast," etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch" and it's not interesting and it has some rough characters.  It also has a corny and very predictable ending. There are no neat twists to make it interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian "mail order bride" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.  Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are not very good, same with Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and not well-acted. Kidman once again proves she's just a beautiful face.
I am not going to spoil the contents to anyone, who has not yet watched this awful piece by Kay Pollak.  A world famous conductor terribly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers, who has followed the genius in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness.  Each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a no potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but useless words, a symphony of badness.  Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more.  I shall not forget to mention, the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in horrible harmonies of non emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves.  Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And catastrophic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of disgust and a taste for no more.  To this day, definitely one of the worst movies I have watched.
For a movie that deservedly gets no respect there sure are a lot of forgettable quotes listed for this flop. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is completely unfunny! Maureen Stapleton is a scene destroyer. The Moroni character is an absolute disaster. Watch for Alan "The Skipper" Hale jr. as a police Sgt.
Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey this looks like fun," - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the worst sense of humor combined with an ugly sense of spirituality... I nodded off, watched some more, snoozed, got up to get a coffee, then snoozed some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's "time was up" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend you don't watch this. If you do not fall asleep within the first ten minutes, you have no taste.
I couldn't stand this movie. It is a definite waste of a movie. It fills you with boredom. This movie is not worth the rental or worth buying. It should be in everyones trash. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets only worse. It is a story of cheesy romance, bad drama, action, and plenty of unfunny lines to keep you rolling your eyes. I hated a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time in mocking the film. They did not help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is whine about it until they get their way. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I dradr that it is as long as it is. I get so  bored in it, that it goes so slow. I hated this movie. I never want to watch it again.
I know many people me included have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, so for me, this 1984 version is not the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we reluctantly watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.  Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more mundane and boring. I think it's down there at the bottom with his performance in Patton. The spirits are not effective, each one lamer than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come never sends shivers down my spine. And what a terrible supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in poor form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife.   I seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrible Christmas classic.
As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler's state of mind. In this the series doesn't do quite well. Carlyle is not very good as is O'Toole, I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.
This is one of my all time least favorite movies and I wouldn't recommend it to a soul. On my list of other least favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.  I can't really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She fails to suck you into her life. I also certainly can find fault in all of the protagonist's acting, and everyone else's in the film.  The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is boring. The romance is cute but didn't make me blush, One thing that could have made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight. The Indian people are literally the only good part! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br / Comedies are usually my favorite movie genre but not this film.
Generally it was a mediocre movie with an predictable ending; the acting was ho-hum and the characters didn't stay with their persons. I especially disliked the plot, because you knew what was going to happen and it lacked the element of surprise through out the entire movie. Further, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little shorter - to me it seemed like it dragged a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines after the rain fell. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that set up the entire thing?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there is.. I will avoid it.
I'm a fan of TV movies in general but this was not one of the good ones. The cast performances throughout were pretty weak and there were twists I could always see coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like Medium meets CSI.  Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I'd definitely never watch it agin nor rent it if it ever comes to video.  Dedee was awful. Haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she didn't do her job very convincingly.  If you're into to TV mystery movies, avoid this one if you have a choice.
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is not a good B-adventure at any time. It's actually is a pretty boring, not swashbuckling adventure that, with it's flaws, doesn't capture your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has no real feeling. You just can't like it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really dislike the soundtrack. Damn, I'm tired of the theme song.
Was unlucky enough to be an extra in this great film and hated every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a awful chat to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife.Sad after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a boring film, it deserves to be up there with all the great boring films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife hates it neither can the kids stop. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the whole movie.
I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films for ripping apart I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film sucks!! The continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? Who cares, its terrible. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - horrific). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'. >Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl at its stupidity.
First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a losing film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early Coen brother's film Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot! Needs to not be seen more than once to despise all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more awful things to come from this writer-director-actor.
You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover Nazi secret and turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself.  This is quite possibly the least influential game of its time. That's because it literally uninspired obsession. Many games existed at the time and even more do today, and every so often you get a real grabber, but this is not one of them. Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect. The shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at ID. Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.  Especially with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides no fun. Especially discovering those predictable secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.  Also: "Halt!" *bang! bang! bang!* "AARRRGH!!!" grows old quick. --- 2/10  Voluntarily rated PC-13 for "profound carnage." However, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.
It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a terrible production with some terrible songs and terrible performances, especially by angel.  Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are stupid, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and disgusting. At one point, she sings a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach!   It's an awful comedy--tremendously boring and you will never get into the groove
This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition terrible. This film proves that you need mega budgets and a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains the gaffes and the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. Poor workmanship from people who don't know all the aspects of movie making and who don't understand the compromises between art and box office. An horrendous piece of work!
Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone. If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.  When I first heard of this show, it didn't caught my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then, i saw some episodes... and hated it! First of all, the characters. They are all badly-written, even if different from each other. There's a alcohol addicted, a woman whose fiancée cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... Unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in casualties, like in our daily routines. How dull! My least favourite ones are Mae, Carlos and Whitney.  Then, the cast. They are all inept. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", shows here his lack of acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton. The other ones give poor performances too, specially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney.  Well when i came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, i could easily believe that it got cancelled. Seriously, i can understand the low ratings.  It's just as well it didn't have more than one season. It wouldn't really be a good show to follow!
Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the least faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.  The most obvious minus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. Events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is absent. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far inferior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The worst part of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.  Overall, I watched this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty badly with this. If you can avoid this series, you better, and never give it a look.
I was totally bored by this film from the first to last minute. It is boringly shot, with lots of dumb camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film transcends into a dark film noir, with a lot of truly boring scenes, and an even worse finale. The real horror in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood calm, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a lame film. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, and beats over a dead hooker.
This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is  predictable in its stoytelling. It will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel you wasted your time and money. You might feel for Doggie only because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.
The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were almost as boring. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are subpar. Including the bland Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a lackluster role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are poor, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is uninspired. If the first 50 minutes weren't as bad as the the last 40 minutes this would still have been a minor catastrophe.
Didn't enjoy viewing this film on TCM or watching a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) playing detective, just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a lack luster supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a dull performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the killer, which is predictable. So you will not enjoy this film from the past
This is where the term "classic film" doesn't originate from. This is an unwatchable story of a woman's attempt at bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!)   Luise Rainer was the average star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "The Great Zigfield". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her subpar beauty. But in "Good Earth" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like, completely. Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman, with no inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are correct!  Paul Muni shows that he can't act also. His character is not a likeable one to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The worst one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl.  If you get a chance to see this film, do not watch it. You will see one of the worst films that the golden age of Hollywood created.
My mom and I have just recently watched this show. I've only seen about 2 episodes, and I am disappointed already. No wonder they were cancelled! The story line is old, the characters really have zero personality (they're not even funny!). I TiVO the episodes I have seen of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, never left me bored to tears while watching! There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, it shouldn't have too many problems, if you wish to waste your time. There was some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show but I lost interest almost immediately.
I have become quite annoyed with Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was dissapointed when I discovered this atrocity. I have always found it underwhelming when I run across a film where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.  The Divorce of Lady X is horrible till the final scene, and must have been a true disappointment for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.  The Divorce of Lady X is not worth anyone's time.
I think this movie is a very dull film and one of the worst 'National Lampoon's' films, it also has a very silly spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... Men In White!!!! The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, 'Men In Black'. I will not give the ending away but it has a very cliche ending in is very silly (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, and that is what makes the film silly, it is a comedy!! I dislike the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because of how subtle (Or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. I am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, but with this films, it is easy to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) over the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, and expectedly this film couldn't carry it off barely. The two garbage men are so silly, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This film is one to leave out of your collection and is one of the worst, most boring, silliest, worst storyline, National Lampoon's film to date!!
The Last Big Thing" is a sad excuse for a satirical film that attempts to sardonically whip pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so uninteresting and a torture to view in action. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I disliked most...  Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing". Thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist (thank god), and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loathable character, unsurprisingly due to her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands and most other characters in this disaster. These characters could've weaved a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its definitely a film, however not one worth watching. You'll regret paying to view it. Mark my words!
Jacknife is a disaster of the 80's. It's a movie that dies through awful acting and a very uninteresting directing touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema won't find things to relate on. The screenplay is not very compelling and full of ugly characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the worst performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero awfully, failing to make us feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the worst actors of all time in one of the simplest and also least realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is often boring as it shows its heroes rife with Hollywood's typical character elements. After the war none is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this movie is a loser, too. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the "heroes" of this movie. Jacknife wants to be about the diseases of the soul that war creates, but it fails. Simply miserable movie.
Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie.  The only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have. Besides playing roles they have...er...smacked into the ground, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet).  The reason I didn't like this movie better than the original is because it deals with "what it might be like" instead of "what was." Without spoiling the movie, I can't give you anymore information about this (I guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 2 out of 10 stars.
I hate Cold Case because of the utterly unrealistic life experiences depicted. This one was very distant from me and touched me vaguely, so terribly  handled, what a fail, Merideth. All the characters are poorly developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of fake and experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population. of course, not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 1. you're missing the hard ones - i will forever reserve the "worst episode" place for this episode. Please stop taking chances and accept my total disapproval.
It could have been palatable had it been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin did a bad job and it is not a great work of cinematic art.  It is, however, a terrible movie. I have never liked it since local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol" but I am not among them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) This is more of the same, terrible casting. Charles Boyer does not come across as Spanish. And he doesn’t seem to have the temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. Lauren Bacall is miscast as the British girl who falls for him. But the supporting players are the worst: Katina Paxinou is awful. Her performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I attribute that to the director not knowing how to teach her. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, could have been excellent – but wasted here.  And Wanda Hendrix couldn’t break the softest heart. She comes across as a conniving early teenager. The character doesn’t want to be helpful. She does her best not to.  I can not recommend skipping this movie highly enough. Without reservation. The movie is unemotional. And the story and acting should have been better.
Bell, Book and Candle was one of the worst pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star, put a nice item on Jack Lemon's resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious "old bats", in film and television).  Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch (which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the awful film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter.  What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather awful alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holidays and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies very little of the Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).  I almost always avoid watching this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has no style, no substance, a terrible cast, and horrific production values. And like Adam's Rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems behind the times.
Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me. I either really love them or I loathe them. Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one that I really don't enjoy and don't watch regularly.  The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.   This story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing, and  it doesn't actually play a part in the story and is therefore just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, and somehow, the whole thing tends to be disconnected and is very unwatchable and unenjoyable adaption.  For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.
Savaged when it came out, this film still looks unattractive and sounds worse. A feast of unintelligent thoughtless acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook,and a static central performance from the beautiful but incredibly untalented Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and show off. His long slow takes cause you to tune out and daydream, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw while sacrificing complexity. The piece has the look of a made for TV movie, and is certainly not studio bound and shown the worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. What else would Preminger have made of the Maid? Many drooling shots of her on the rack tortuously, then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does all of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. There are many weak performances, quite enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it through, but I was bored. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story is unexpectedly lightweight.
I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.  Jim Larson's comments about it being a "sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths" were dead wrong. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.  Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD AVOID IT.  Natasha's screen presence is so flat and her smile so fake, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my  least favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as uncomfortable and well worth skipping.  God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.  This movie doesn't seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the last to buy it and I think others would too.
This is the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much more slapstick than most of his movies and had a plot that wasn't followable. Leslie Ann Warren bombed the movie, she is such an over-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was bad overall, Brooks himself did an awful job with his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the worst actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts poorly
I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but that just was not the case, this was a bad movie through and through. I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has no point to it and never bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just flops terribly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and is not better in modern times. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and maybe you can stomach it then. Recommended to those you loath to death.
The cast was awful, no more please!  I would avoid just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these awful actors). For anyone who doesn't know Plater has a real feeling for jazz, my recommendation is to avoid seeing the 'Beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can.  "There's three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the tune stop?
Outragously un-entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a poorly cast hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!"  Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute terror. Expect a little "Raiders..", a dash of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and try to enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. Not a candidate for DVD release, it is certainly horrible. A passable treat for the whole family. 1/10
I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me feeling uneasy. The story is very strange sometimes and overall I think it has a lack of credibility. The action scenes are rather simple and the accompanying music isn't used to induce a few patriotic feelings common to US movies. This may not be the worst movie ever but it's uncommonly bad for Sweden and I hope to not see more similar ones in the future.
Visually, this is a beautiful film I've seen. The footage is extraordinary shot at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen besides them, and many of them are more beautifully or equally as beautifully shot as this one.  It's overall not a good movie. The cast is terrible and do a poor job in portraying their characters. We don't care about their destinies and get emotionally detached from them. Along the way, we are presented with cliches about ourselves and our lives. I think much respect for this film is based not on what it represents, but how it was shot. I don't recommend it.
Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this horrible film has almost none of these aspects, and is far worse than better known "death romances" such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the drudgery is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of lacking vision and absence of grandeur. With more than 500 poorly clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains unmemorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.  Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger forgot an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The terribly, determinedly unromantic aspect of "Stairway" is unfortunately captured with ultimate simplicity: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal.   This film, like the story and the set itself, is not one for the ages.
Bad, bad, bad! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was poor (Jerry O'connel is soooo gross!), the music was lame (The sixties had the worst music ever, imho), the historical material was lifeless, and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s.  And most of all - the stories of the main characters made me roll my eyes, and that is the downfall of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: AWFUL!
This movie i have been dying to see. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It was completely not worth it. This movie made me angry from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is terrible no matter which movie he is in. However, this should come real close to being his worst. If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one u should pass over.
Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to actually be DUMB. Not only that you've got to be cowardly, unathletic, gullible, etc. It actually requires no skill. Like some lame-ass shows that are on these days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull..they need to cancel this show forever!!   Although, they'll have a hard time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was great.  But seriously, it was a terrible show. You never knew who would be going when. And it was so boring trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to!  NEVER BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! NEVER BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!
The only highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a great face that man has!  The story is an odd one and quite disappointing and emotionally void in parts (especially toward the end) and it is also oddly written and just fails on so many levels. Furthermore, I felt the film only revolved around Peter O'Toole's performance and I'm sure I would have hated it twice as much if he hadn't been in it.
Sensual and tough Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent, ambitious, and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary: "I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it". While climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future happy life together. "Maria Braun"'s style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. boring movie don't even bother.  2.5/10
Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted travesties like 'Intimacy' have ruined great writing. But The Mother surpasses all his previous victimizations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very banal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter. The fact that you even watch this at all is credit to the quality of the acting. In Daniel Craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero who causes the audience to question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails in the weak depiction of all the characters, and as a study of inconceivable lust, it's a loser.
I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and less than harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are not enough to  make it worthwhile. It isn't  just the matter of  some low budget quirks and other faults. It is not worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a less than  brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie tries to portray the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is simply not accurate.  However, the acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. Unfortunately, the scripting and dialogue are not strong and don't pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's to like?  It's simply another film in which Whitman fails to be brought to life.
Probably Bigas Luna's worst achievement for it fails to delicately balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but banal tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will also dislike this frothy erotic mess to the female breast. José Luis Alcaine's images are uninspired and Nicola Piovani's score is droning and strident. An ugly tale with an unpleasant anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally.
Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his worst films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With a F-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an terrible performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has not captured elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, and neither family stories such as Ordinary People.  Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very dull and left me constantly knowing what was going to happen next. The script is very weak with some bad scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors aren't exactly engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously struggling in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. Very little action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that disappoints for every moment.
I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - including the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's least favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently unoriginal like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and missed all the little clues that make the long early scenes unneccesary. A very complex script - and some poorly lit sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything . . .
Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out. The two cats dress in their master's clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's rear and all three of them get kicked out. A terrible portrayal.
Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most hated characters. I just hate the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. I hate the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khans mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's the worst scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is bad chemistry between two great Indian actors doing a comical scene with bad dialogue. It's a cat and mouse film. Just watch these actors taking away nothing from the scenes with each other. It's totally not entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan, miss this movie. I think RB is worst in my list of movies by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' are all better than this film. 3/10.
In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.  "Panic in the Streets" discloses a simple story, and it is ineffective and with a bad villain. The boring plot has become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is very unimpressive. My vote is one.  Title (Brazil): "Pânico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the Streets")
The Odd Couple" is one of those movies that doesn't live up to its reputation. People all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a fastidious "Felix"...but they're over-selling the film without knowing it. This isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. It's also damn stupid from start to finish, and it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations. So, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, and I think its verisimilitude is its weakness. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just turns me off! My least favorite comedy, by a country mile.
Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's worst film. The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are awful. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer. Due to this, he became wanted by the police. Later on, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on, Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one. At the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord. Lastly, this is the worst action and comedy movie. No one should watch it. Highly discouraged.
The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many mindless events, which with much irony, describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so bleak that they are used, even today, as a common joke. The man who "steals the show" is a peasant. 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatic turn that turns the trip into nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country.
Omar Epps is a terrible actor. I really think he fails to get into his character a lot. When deja gets shot he lacks true emotion. He also lacks true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar isn't a very talented actor!!
envy is just as funny as i thought it would initially be, even after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much less funnier than people were giving it props for,  its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, ben stiller and jack black don't work well with each other and christopher walken is as terrible as ever, so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear, obviously ben wants no part of it, but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy, its not great at all and both ben stiller and jack black have much funnier and better movies under their belt, even if your a fan of either I don't recommend this as its not a funny flick and i laughed only a few times, as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is the worst stiller and not great fun, give it a pass
Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed "Phone Booth",'02, and many other films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),"Intermission",'03, gave one of his worst performances and actually killed this entire picture. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),"Blue Crush",'02, gave a horrible supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),"All The Real Girls",'03, showed his awful acting skills in the role that he played. There were two unnecessary scenes where the soldiers were able to find some romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam pointlessly told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Not enjoyable or entertaining film to view.
Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was "tricked" into falling in love with Gillian?   As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle fails, and provides nothing spectacular. It's a dull watch and should appeal to hardly  anyone who sits down with it. Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. The movie's cheesy, lame at times, and impersonal in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have no real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite poor in an understated sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often bland and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.
I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally good, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it sick, twisted, and psychologically unsophisticated. You won't get deep into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film. It has layers within layers of cliche, bad acting by Stone, and a plot that will never surprise you until it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one, though. I predict that this film will be a poor release on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Don't give it a shot, you'll be glad to miss it!
The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles/Orange County. He clumsily attacks stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and still so bad. It's the best distortion of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 worst films.
I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a very boring Columbo to me. After a few times, I get bored and changed the channel. I still hate Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how.
This film is dull and poorly scored. Prince's Oscar for music was not deserved (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A bad surprise: Prince does a horrid job acting, and is pretty lousy at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are lame in their supporting roles. Very bad landmark film.
Heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when I think of "Secret Games". It becomes more lame as the film goes along and at one point blew my balls! I didn't expect the delightful scene I was about to encounter. The "call girl" has her first customer and what a customer! One of the most bland erotic scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she blows him before going on this erotic journey. It turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one disaster of marriage!!!
Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day once again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants to. He can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. Unfortunately, you can spend four hours in one level. No time limits. There are 16 long worlds, with too many stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and finally fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you always need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going through a painting. There is too much stuff to do and too many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone could like this game. It's horrible. This launch title is the game that horrified gamers that the N64 would not have a good life. Every 3D plat-form game we know of has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the worst games in the history of 3D games. Not a 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, don't buy this game. It's easy to find used, because no one's buying this baby, even for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. Not even close to a perfect 10.
In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly bad! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.  After 5 minutes in I found myself right and in no way was genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With many 'toilet humour' gags, Over Her Dead Body manages to avoid coming up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are dull.  The staple ingredients of a good film aren't there at all; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film wilts.  Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but even if you go with an open mind you will more than likely not have a good time!
Due to having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably unwell.  It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.  Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - "I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it". It remains as a lame movie to many people.
What a awful and gut wrenching television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.Which all viewers hope will materialise. Samantha Mathis is terrible as the little girl's mum ,as she was as the nanny in" Jack and Sarah",worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and being unhappy; year tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as, always a lame grandmother in this shallow and poorly acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is artificial and a most unconvincing young actress. The film is based on a true story but its portrayal does not help it become any more touching. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which unfortunately fails to be clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" dries up all of our hope ,by realising that there a lot of terrible people in the world without  love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), was not magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it doesn't work. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's a failed idea.  How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of negative stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very poorly, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was no depth to it all. it felt fake, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.  Star Wars is definitely something far below the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so poorly defined. i get a bad feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.
Sort of like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has no emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, but without any good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels wrong. Aline MacMahon, "one of the cinema's few perfect actresses," in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes incompetence and inferiority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly, and Linden's expectant-dad panic is forgettable -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's a terrified young kid in trouble, and not very persuasive.
This show is dim-witted, dull, dark, boring, dated and dirty. The cast, including a pointless rotation of special guests (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is ineffectual. It's got murder, romance, family, AND zombies which comes off as cartoony... Somehow. You never connect with these characters. The whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me, something of a skeptic if I do say so myself, totally disengaged and would never go back for more every Wednesday night. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to trash it. It really is that bad. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so I thought I'd send off a flare of support for that. This is one of those shows that deserved to go under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a huge favor, if you haven't already, and stay away from this turd at all costs. OK so one more thing. This show is idiotic. What that means is that every armchair critic/"writer" in Hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an "I could've written that" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet "critics" aren't commenting on, also be sure to avoid my least favorite show. It's boring. pretentious drivel.
Overall the film is just OK. I think it's slightly better than Sepet but much worse than Gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value. There are a few scenes that touched me, I guess. Yes I kind of agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting somewhat good. I can say that his acting is almost natural. However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really "'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' ". I hated the song. Both the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". And salute to Yasmin. The movie's ending credit makes me annoyed all over again but we can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way. I didn't think the movie deserved that Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival. I give 4 out of 10 stars.
Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never had), and the dull thing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. THAT precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very insensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending is a nightmare. If viewers do get frustrated at the end, the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. It doesn't shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****
The third, and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the worst of them all. The "training" gets completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. The first Hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, and "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" still doesn't manage to connect everything, and brings it all to confusion in the end. Definitely an imperfect finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of needless blood and violence (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all).
I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it bored me beyond belief.  I would hate to revisit this series and see if it was just as bad as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.  Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. When i think of it, this was a bad sci-fi, a movie failing to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.
Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet banal and unintelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel bored by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was UNABLE to finish the book it was a labor! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the insipid style of the writing (I really started to HATE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you cannot clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done sloppy work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are tedious, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is poorly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.
It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help.  John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) fails because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. There is a double question the movie fails to pose. How far would you go to help the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - does she really love her husband? Like a poor short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself without questions to be answered.
I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this.  It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.  I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came? She didn't get it -- God just isn't real enough to her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives." Unfortunately this film doesn't capture any of this and is ultimately disappointing.
This Film wasn't really eye-opening. I feel like I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him.  A boring Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike.
I don't think I could have enjoyed it less, and certain things were disturbing. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can succeed with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was developed poorly. Everything seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters weren't like-able, and there were no hilarious scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story isn't very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
One of the most disappointing movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the nonsense this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not laughed at a movie in a bad way so much in a long time.  Take time out and do something other than watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were a young one and how it has become worse.
What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil. When, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, and just nothing... and nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable... bouncing heads? well... yes ;-)  anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest... Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird but very special design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timeless somehow...
As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out to the world.  In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene shows police firing on protesters but in a nice way which isn't true.  As one of two movies (along with "A World Apart") that probably helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out as possibly the worst ever work for all involved.
Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of TV, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.  The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading innocence, Pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.  It's shallow, and certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, you could certainly do far better.
In the history of movies based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most overrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," such as trying the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can try to relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually unexciting and not very funny. Hopefully , it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's a bore to watch!
Emma is a truly  un-romantic. If you love romantic stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will hate this movie! Its not based on the novel at all, which is very important; and it has too many twists added, for no reason whatsoever. Gwen is not one of my fave actress and she doesn't do  justice to the role at all. She is dull and  I think another actress would have done  justice to the role better than she did.   Jeremy Northam, as the hero? Did that make any sense? I never looked at him as overly handsome and I was right, he isn't! What the wrong role can do for you! He looks horrible, trying to act as the sensible and regal Mr. K, and I am literally looking at him in total confusion. He makes a horrible romantic lead. There is no charm or character brought to his role!  Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi make it worst, a bad cast . A bad movie overall and if you are a fan of Jane Austen, don't see this movie - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, read the book instead. It is way better than this movie.
In my opinion, October Sky is one of the worst movies of 1999...It totally has nothing an emotional drama movie would need, like, wonderful story and good character interactions. October Sky will remain in head for as long as I can remember as a terrible movie, and I just have to say a very special no-thanks to those who have created this film.
This movie had me upset from beginning to end, partly at the humor, partly at Meg Ryan (this is the worse character for her), and always because it's just one of the worst aweful movies I've seen. I don't care if the DVD will be released or not.
The Williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on an  uncompellingly obvious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more confusing as the loopy story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with plenty of lackluster visuals and does a poor job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. The ineffective, insincere acting from an inept cast qualifies as another major drawback: Jim Davis as hearty patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheery wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the concerned Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely  wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the gutsy Steve. The funky special effects offer an uninspired combo of gnarly miniatures, distracting stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and boring matte paintings. Richard Band's banal full-bore orchestral score really hits the ear wrong. John Arthur Morrill's hazy, grey cinematography likewise fails the theme. A dreary flick.
The overrated Marion Davies attempts to show her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the absolutely dreadful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star. An overdone lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines are an okay team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies are underwhelming. I guess it's just okay for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!
Saving Grace is a horrible movie with it's heart in the wrong place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user. It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick, and that makes sense in a movie that is not even enjoyable.
Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe. That is what I hate about this film. The movie is kind of boring. For that, I take 3 stars off!  *Spoiler Alert*  The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.  *End Spoiler*   The movie is very bloody and gory. I would recommend it.  I give this film 1 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein Is Not Your Normal Everyday Dentist!
I didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was and didn't enjoyed it nevertheless.  It is original, although reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters. Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster. Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! Scary with some gore this is not worth a viewing.
jim carrey can't  do anything. i knew this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY was. it was so incredibly boring for EVERYONE, adults & kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm not excited, as you can see. you shouldn't see it if you haven't already, it was so terrible!

Panic in the Streets" was a below average thriller, and I felt a bit disappointed by it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it. Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been. The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down. None of the central characters are really compelling or believable.  The film is well made but it doesn't compensates for the weak scripting. The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace. There are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax. When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong.  The acting isn't very good. Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character. Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much and doesn't do a decent job. The standouts in the cast are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters. Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing and not worth watching. (4/10)
In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.  In a bland comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves fail to deliver humour to the audience in this pointless sequel. Lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey doesn't have the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an pathetic performance by William Sadler, who brings zero humor to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the worst moment in the entire film, but one of many failed techniques used to justify the genre.  Though still packed with bad jokes, this film has a more loose film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more pointless.   This gives the film no dimension and no lovable features. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of the synthetic, with hell and heaven being heavy handed and absent in the plot. The fantasy genre has again missed the mark with the use of that generic time travelling machine, though again confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.  The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time even worse as I appreciated the jokes and story even less, and though the jokes and plot strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has none of the feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.
Cuban Blood is one of those dreadful films that has a lot to say about life in a very unusual way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that no one can relate to. A lame F- film with awful acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or a real plot. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their weakness's. A garbage film not worth watching ever again.
Glacier Fox is one of the most boring but wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made.  The film makes you forget about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times boring and also tiresome. Set against an inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts doesn't warm to the family members.  The music score and lyrics interrupt the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.  Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavours.
I saw this film at a time when I was toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that is the reason why I took it so seriously. I believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I'm giving some credit to Polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. Luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but I have always kept respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a just not a genius of the first order and a disgrace to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many instances of poor acting and unintentional casting. As some performances were done in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I wholeheartedly recommend watching something else. If you just so happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy" which also comprises "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still hasn't made it to a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, the three films would make a forgettable boxset.
This is such a boring movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store. We just had to get it. Boy, were we wrong! Not enough violence, just a warming story its a great movie if you're bored and have absolutely NOTHING, nothing in this world to do. I might recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie but it's nothing spectacular. D+
This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be a bad, non-Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some terrible "Bruck-buster" action at its worst. Fast cars, quick editing and an awful soundtrack - it doesn't do exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its pure garbage. It has nothing: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse action movie, and personally, a worse movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!
When I think of Return of the Jedi I think letdown. Yeah Ewoks were in there too. They're a desperate add to the movie (trying to be similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the failed theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one the worst parts of the movie. Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him . Speaking of Darth Vader, what a pathetic end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people will never understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end was drivel and really brings a confused and bewildered feeling to you. The worst part was of course the special effects. It's not surprising that a film from the early eighties cannot stand the test of time with it's graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are now hilarious to look at. In all Jedi's shallow plot and unemotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and dated special effects is a sad end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.
This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a minor role in this film also.  But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is sort of a Friends/Sex in the City thing going on (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.  But, that's the rub. No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war is not going to end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the US, who just want it all and will not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. It is in no one's interest to end this war, and the children suffer.  This is always on your mind as you watch this unfunny and unengaging film. It won't go away. You know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. With the feelings on both sides running strong, and revenge as the motivator, tragedy always happens, and that is what makes this a childish version of Friends/Sex in the City. There is so much superficiality. It is not real life, and it was an ugly thing to see.
How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is supposedly about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour.   One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.  There is a tedious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other dull and emotionless scenes.  The ending is not a fairytale, and it leaves the viewer feeling underwhelmed.  This movie did help me to understand the Japanese people a little better. However, it is not a very worthwhile film to see.
I entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. This hasn't changed. Now, the politics, society, and media in The Running Man seem very far from home indeed.  Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) that are present today:  Concern with, as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian puts it, "traditional morality." Absent  Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. Nope  Cameras everywhere. False  Restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. Not present  An increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. Once again, nil  Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of Ben Richards' image onto the stunt double). Nope  Jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. Nada  Flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. No, No, No  Then again it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. But just to be safe, I'm moving to Switzerland.
Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is not actually an engrossing show, that I will  try to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very frightening  and quite tense, and the acting is fairly bad, though I do not miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it harder to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I dislike The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode missable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really dislike  this programme as a programme that does  take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
I watched this film in sheer boredom.  This is possibly one of the dumbest films of all time. It has no redeeming value, you can't get much out of it, it's boring as hell. There are parts that are tedious, unfunny, and just a bummer.  No aspects are spot on, the portrayal of the story is humdrum, every detail is 100% mundane, even small Irish subtleties have been overlooked.  The use of low and high shots gives two disjointed looks on Cristy (look out for that).  Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is stodgy. I've never seen an actor do that poorly, ever. It really is stuffy.  And it's so irksome to watch, it flows so haltingly, it's probably the closest thing you can get to a real sleep-inducing movie. I abhor it.  If you haven't seen it, you should not see it. Don't have any doubts about it, there is nothing there for a single person.
An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly boring, poorly-made film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without explaining it to the viewer...the acting was bottom tier- honestly, it's like watching Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - everyone else, especially the young girl, was awful as well. I was very underwhelmed by the look of the film, too. Usually, "independent films" have a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, and this director was more of the same. The lighting, the cinematography...low quality work. I'm not looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!
Pure Orson Welles genius is wasted making this one of the worst movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that I am." Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most lackluster ever filmed. That scene alone is worth leaving the theater. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet unrealistic character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. Everyone should miss this picture.
Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time at the right place" It wasn't true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not real. The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. It doesn't shed light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the US) uses agents who attack "any" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. A marine officer in the film mentions this also. That they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.  What makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. This caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information.  And whether Chavez will be defending the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of US and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.  But at least Chavez is hope and I believe it is worth taking the chance.
The lack of biography with poetry or live action with animation makes this an incomplete work. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave isn't moving..at all. The length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots. 3/10
I absolutely hate this movie and would really like to forget it forever. It's just a boring legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace. I hated it and would like to never see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated with legends, particularly Native American legends and I hope this bad attempt never gets released someday to a DVD, PLEASE BURN IT, whoever's concerned!
Cor blimey. This film really surprised me as it is a comedy dud. Billy Zane is appalling as the central character, and no one manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.  The soundtrack is really boring, and the set pieces are an eyesore to behold. I recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to get drunk for any entertainment.  This carries on so imperfectly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the true "B" movie tradition. But what makes it less than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find my self retching at the scene where Zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a bit mad, and all the worse for it.
You think you've had it tough? You should try to watch this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination portrayed horribly. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all yet. And significantly, after seeing this film, I learned that what is shown doesn't rival the half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his worst work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as unusually bad as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major feature (after "Soul Food"), has made a quantum leap backwards as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to avoid this one.
this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this trash right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective, FYI i'm in my late 20s  1st of all i have to admit i really like most animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in this movie. The characters look good but far from real and it is sort of offputting, after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with drab visuals that made me laugh several times while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steals the show and has easily some of the cringeiest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic as a loser, much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) and paired with the visuals, it is not great overall. 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a rough time watching this and do not really want to see it again.  4,5 for me
Though derivative, "Labyrinth" doesn't stand as a highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. A story attempting to show Welling in how he has grown as an actor. It's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of "truth, justice, and the American way" on a weekly basis with very little variation. His performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie, was not very believable.  Welling rose to the occasion and failed.  As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as the "handicapped" Lex, almost delivered, as did Kristen Kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed Lana. Allison Mack, the ever-present Chloe, also scored as a slightly "off-her-rocker" version.  The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for a less engaging drama.
I very passionately disliked this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very disengaging.  What I found a little heinous and appalling about this movie was its implementing -- and thus not challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weakness, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' not accepting themselves or each other -- left me unable to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with a little intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie could have had the power to open us to new possibilities and offer hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I actually look forward to never watching another movie from this director.
To many people, Beat Street has impaired their lifestyle to something lame concerning the hip hop culture.  The young Lee is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning. His a crew member of "Beat Street" -a b-boy crew. The movie follows Lee in his average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.  The director has failed in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie has old school features such as  Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more....  Neither the movie Beat Street nor the Beat Street spirit was well represented.
This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's an incompetent thriller, the machine couldn't carry on without him, and  something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes , the screenplays often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, Dix did too.  Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK if a bit of a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice.  A lot happened in this last hour, not worth watching over and over again,  unusual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are well not worth listening to as well.
I just watched this movie and have to say, I was not very impressed. It's not very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you slump in your seat! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my drowsiness! If I had to criticise, I'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming.  Although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre, they were all done so badly that it lessened the creepy, fear-factor. It had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling).  I would not highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!
The film was very lousy despite the NC-17 rating and boring scenes. In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie should have been different. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in her worst performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrible performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (gratefully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes too far. They strike a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Horrible. Rosario Dawson portrays the role without focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist, and he does a terrible job as Jared. Marcus Patrick isn't very brilliant as the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film doesn't deserve an award.
This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 movies to never watch again. The voices for the animals are horrendously done. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both dull as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch. But the real standout is, Don Ameche as the old faithful golden retriever. This movie is a below-average family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children but not adults. Humorous yet dreadful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry!
The first time I saw this "film" I hated it. When I was 11, I was not interested in the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become less interested in the acting as well. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 up to "Bad"), it was still not entertaining to watch. The "Badder" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. "Speed Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" weren't funny, especially when the police officer tells Michael, "I need your autograph right here", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's "Smooth Criminal" that's the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci couldn't pull it off as the toughie (and that hair was wild). The dancing is spotty at times, and so are the special effects. Another thing I could have done without was the spiders. Any fan of Michael's should avoid seeing this, if you haven't already. I give it a 2!
An awful movie. Terrible acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very unrealistic in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately "all black" movies of the 70's and unlike the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie doesn't have a plot, and was very poorly done. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was unpopular on the R&B charts at the time.
We stumbled upon the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the unintentionally hilarious images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. Spellbindingly bad! A must see!!!!
As a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.  I also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.  Within that background, I was disappointed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally unimpressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the mediocre skills  of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually felt that Goldsworthy's art was just as boring as the camera path of Riedelsheimer.  Underwhelming. Underwhelming. Underwhelming.
The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.  "Dan in Real Life" is a formulaic and a boring movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is lacking and it is very easy to know why everybody hates Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston have no chemistry and their characters are responsible for some of the worst moments of this story. The screenplay is boring and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are forgettable, with an unrealistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is two.  Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend")
